Objects, photographs and smells all contain the power to evoke powerful and immediate pangs and feelings that whisk us away to far-off places and oft-forgotten periods of our lives.  For nearly two years I have dealt mainly in pictures. A camera and a pair of binoculars are pre-requisites for a seasoned safari-goer, and in an effort to make the most of my time in this secluded pocket of wilderness, I have followed suit.  My dedication to this unfamiliar sport has been anything but consistent. I should keep my camera at my side each day, but most days it stays buried in a lovely backpack next to my bed.  My carelessness has led to more than a few missed opportunities to photograph elephants shaking the roof of the office, or hornbills stealing sausages and cakes with increasing confidence and skill.</p>, <p>This past month was particularly disappointing. Distracted by work I failed to take a single photo, save a few I snapped to prove to the office that the spinach being sent from town was not, in fact, spinach. I’ve felt slightly stifled and confused lately by my presence here, and abandoning this newfound hobby was doing me no good. So it was when I found myself on a game drive with a family of American clients last week. Camera in tow, I departed camp ready to soak up the bush with fresh perspective and the wonder that had drawn me to make a home amongst the wild things.</p>, <p>On this particular evening we were looking for a lion. He and his brother had been moving in and out of our concession for months now, but in an exciting development, he had impregnated a resident female. Our guide had found him asleep on the morning drive, and predicted that he would rouse just before sunset to begin his patrol. We found him in a deep and peaceful slumber. For most animals, sleep is a dangerous exercise. Some part of the creature remains awake, acutely conscious of the dangers that surround her. The lion is king. He fears little in dreaming, and has the luxury of spending a great deal of his time submitting to the exhaustion wrought by a life of dominating, wandering and fighting.  Watching his belly rise and fall, it was hard to believe that this beast would ever stir.  We left him to explore the surrounding bush, distracting ourselves with a lone elephant crossing the Savuti Channel. As the sun neared the end of its journey to the bottom of the horizon, we returned to the lion to be rewarded for our patience. His head snapped up at our approach and we were greeted with the face of Africa’s strongest predator.</p>, <p>When I have not seen a lion for a few weeks or months, I am easily stunned by its astonishing size. A lion walks on huge paws that one can easily imagine swiping at unlucky prey, with a massive mane and deep eyes that I’ve heard can pierce the heart with a single glance. There was just enough light left to photograph him, and within a few minutes I was ensconced in an effort to secure the perfect shot.  With a camera at your side an encounter like this can seem worthless without the pictures to show the world that you were there. Of course, his poise was not what had drawn us to his side that day; we had come to hear him roar.</p>, <p>It started with a low groan. The call grew louder and louder until we could feel the strength of its echo on the ground. I remember hearing the lion’s call as a child on my very first safari. My terror was such that I cried under the covers, certain that he was about to tear apart the canvas door and charge inside. My fears had faded with time, but the call was no less powerful.  The light was fading fast and my photographs were hazy and blurred along the edges. As I covered my lens I saw the flash of cameras struggling to capture every inch of remaining light.  What did it matter now that his voice was so totally illuminated?</p>, <p>I wondered at how incredible it was that so much life could be contained in a single roar. Tonight he was calling for a female who was hiding from him. As long as she evaded his calls, her cubs, the offspring of another lion who lay to the East, would remain with her. Once discovered, her young boys would be chased away in an effort to establish dominance over her and the land she calls home. It may seem sad to us, but the survival of the species depends on this rite of passage. All male lions face banishment once they enter adulthood. They must become nomads, wandering alone until they are mature enough to attempt to win new territory. They will face the wrath of competing males eager to fight their advances. Each fight holds the promise of land, of females and a chance to father young of their own. The prize may be a few years as head of one or several lion prides, with females to hunt for them and cubs to carry their legacy. A dominant male will sleep with a full belly and the awareness that his rule is under constant threat from a lion with greater strength than he.</p>, <p>The only certainty in a lion’s life is that one day it will end. He may die at the hands of a greater opponent. He may survive the fight only to run in the knowledge that he has lost to new blood. He may not fight at all, instead choosing to accept his fate as the weaker cat and take his place amongst the nomads. The story will always close with his death, alone and unwanted. The winner will kill his cubs and mate with his females, while his tired body returns to dust. His time on this earth is short, but it is undoubtedly filled with more fight and determination than most of us can imagine exercising during our own lifetimes. It is this indomitable spirit that reaches us when we hear him call in the darkness.</p>, <p>It’s true that images have the capacity to preserve countless pieces of our existence. We create them to remember fleeting moments of joy and sadness, and to extract a speck of permanence from the constant movement of life that we can return to again and again. A few days after my evening with the lion, I examined the photos and looked into his eyes. I saw a stoic and proud beast and smiled, remembering all the nights I heard the lion call and felt blessed to be in the presence of such power and beauty. I sensed too that the call of this particular lion had awakened something else within me. The lion calls to tell all around him, “here I am.” Some will flee in his wake, and others will answer him with a challenge that may end his life. With each call he risks his survival, because he can achieve no victory in silence. If we listen carefully, we may find our own fleeting courage renewed.</p>]","[<p>

Our names are often chosen long before we have taken our first breaths. They are imbued with meanings that have little to do with us, and more to do with the hopes and loves of those we belong to. Names are the remains of people we will never meet and the promise of untold potential for a full and meaningful life. The ties that bind us to our names will weaken as we grow, but we will carry the weight of their source with us always. My name, loosely translated, means “a gift from our fathers.” My parents both lost their fathers when they were just a little older than I am now, a fact that I have come to appreciate with a sharper sense of understanding as I approach the age at which they experienced such profound loss. There are few people who address me with this name outside of my immediate family, but it is a gift that I keep close to my heart, perhaps closer now that I find myself so far from home.</p>, <p>It seems that the naming of things is part of what makes us human. Now that I live in a place where animals far outnumber people, I find it difficult not to share this rite with all the creatures I encounter. The first to be named was a gecko that appeared nearly every night on the wall above my bedside lamp. While I read in bed, he took advantage of this small patch of light to hunt for insects. A part of me knew that it was highly unlikely for the same gecko to visit me each evening; my house was, after all, abuzz with insects and the lizards that preyed on them. Even so, discovering this gecko was the closest I had come to having a roommate in over three years, and I could not resist making him my own. Inspired by my favourite Paul Simon song, I called him Al. I spent many happy evenings with Al by side, enjoying the calm of night after a long day at work, as he feasted on mosquitoes. Summer has long since passed and my walls are bare. I like to think that Al is hiding in a warm corner of the house, waiting for the bitter cold of African winter to subside so that he can keep me company again.</p>, <p>Of course it is folly to believe that we can give names to these creatures. The truth is that I cannot name the geckos in my house any more than I can name the lone bull elephant who delights me with his frequent attempts to acquire the freshest shoots, whatever the cost to the camp’s boardwalks and railings. His presence here has led me to feel that I know him well, but he does not belong to me. He belongs to his own family of giants, even if they have, as nature dictates, pushed him out of the herd and forced him to make his way in the world alone. His is a state of solitude unknown to many of us. Our desire to name and hold onto the people we love, wherever they may roam, is fundamental to our humanity.</p>, <p>At its core, a name signifies that we owe our existence to another and bestows upon us a sense of belonging and family. As we enter new stages of life and belief, our names evolve and change. I have collected several over the years that would sound utterly nonsensical and bizarre to most. Each one is tied to the tears and laughter of friendships that have weathered both time and distance. While I feel immense gratitude for the chance I have been given to make a life here in the wilderness of my dreams, I am equally grateful for all the names I have taken with me. There are days when I am as cut off from home as the elephant, and yet I have never felt alone.</p>]","[<p>

Dust and the young buds of summer make for watery eyes and patience about as short as a pinhead. On one particularly hot afternoon, the only thing preventing me from screaming at the next person who addressed me was the knowledge that at 4:00, nearly twelve hours after I had arrived at work that day, I would be able to jump into the pool and find relief from the sun. When I heard that a single guest would be remaining in camp after teatime to sit by the pool, preventing me from jumping in myself, my eyes stung with tears. I recall this with total honesty and little shame. This is the kind of manic desperation and unruly emotion commonly experienced and witnessed in the weeks before November rains. Humans are most certainly not the only creatures affected by the temperature. The earth is parched. Elephants pull down trees with increased vigour in an effort to acquire fresh leaves and bark. The heightened competition for food leaves the stench of death all around us.</p>, <p>Two evenings ago I was privy to a close viewing of a scene that is common at this time of year. The impala are nearly ready to drop their young. Most of the females are pregnant, and this renders them less able to run from predators. The three wild dog packs in this concession seek to take advantage of this weakness as often as possible. We cannot paint them as cruel; they too have growing young to worry about. Feeding ten adults and ten puppies requires frequent hunting, and this day was no different.</p>, <p>As I made my way across the boardwalk to my house, I had sleep and work on my mind. Unfinished orders were looming, the heat was pressing, and in thirty minutes I had to come back on duty when I all I wanted was to cocoon myself in a corner of the walk-in-fridge. My train of thought was broken just long enough to see an impala bolt between the boardwalks of two guest tents. A wild dog followed in hot pursuit. I quickly followed them to the edge of the boardwalk along the water’s edge, but they were nowhere to be found. Curious, but still pressed for time, I continued walking along the boardwalk and prepared to descend the stairs onto the pathway that led to my own house. My eyes met with another wild dog, eyeing me from only a few hundred feet away. Something told me to stay put, and perhaps only a minute later, a second impala came crashing through the woods, another dog close behind. I ran to the balcony of the closest guest room and saw the scared impala nearly submerged in the water, a wild dog watching intently from the bank. Just then, a third impala ran towards the water, and this time I knew escape was impossible. Six dogs descended upon the female, and in less than ten minutes, a few bones were all that remained. I was in such a daze of shock and awe that I had little time to consider the weight of what was transpiring. Six of Africa’s rarest predators had hunted and killed a few metres from where I stood, gazing at me with faces covered in fresh blood. I saw a yellow-billed kite swoop down and fly away with the antelope’s heart, while another dog picked up what appeared to be a newborn impala. Of course this baby was still a few weeks from its birthdate. Slowed by her impending labour, this mother stood no chance against her attackers. Now they enjoyed a feast of not one, but two impala.</p>, <p>I had often wondered if I would be able to withstand the gruesome sight of wild dogs hunting successfully. They kill viciously and rip into flesh without pause, while the animal still struggles for breath. In silence I stood listening to birds sing from treetops as the late afternoon sun pounded down upon an unborn baby torn from its womb and tossed in the grass. Despite the sadness and brutality of the scene, it was one I knew I would remember vividly and with immense gratitude. I had heard of and imagined moments like this one, but never considered that I might one day pull back the curtain on the wildness of beasts. In the span of a few minutes I witnessed nature’s precious interchange between life and death. Two lives are taken to feed twenty. The impala mate and drop young at the same time each year, so that these inevitable losses will not prevent a mass of new life emerging. This balance is maintained without the influence of man or machine, and has been for thousands of years. A life within this kingdom of hunter and hunted is the stuff of wishes whispered to a universe we pray is listening.</p>, <p>The heat still bears down on all of us. I drift between frustration, exhaustion, and twinges of madness. Each time we hear distant echoes of thunders our hearts fill with hope for rain. Brief storms have offered only a few hours of relief, but the earth remembers them. Driving along the road to camp I see a lone green shoot of grass that was not there the day before. No drop of rain is wasted and each afternoon is a little cooler than the last. In a place where the storm comes before the calm, we discover that every bit of water counts. Instead of dwelling on a bright sky that cannot be willed to open, we find respite in the first signs of summer, in the kind words and laughter offered by those whose patience exceeds our own, and more than that, in the wonder wrought by the trials and victories of creatures who have suffered and survived this season long before we made our homes here. Hot and bothered, we find our dreams fulfilled.</p>]","[<p>
			Posted <span class=""by-author""> by <span class=""author vcard""><a class=""url fn n"" href=""https://thelilacelephant.com/author/abiellasf/"" rel=""author"" title=""View all posts by abiellasf"">abiellasf</a></span></span> in <a href=""https://thelilacelephant.com/category/botswana/"" rel=""category tag"">Botswana</a> </p>, <p><strong>Tags</strong></p>, <p><a href=""https://thelilacelephant.com/tag/botswana/"" rel=""tag"">Botswana</a>, <a href=""https://thelilacelephant.com/tag/hornbills/"" rel=""tag"">Hornbills</a></p>, <p>Something strange has been happening on the vanity of the front of house bathroom. We refer to it as a “loo with a view,” because it has no doors and is open on three sides to the lagoon and its cornucopia of furry and feathered inhabitants. This view adds a bit of excitement to the otherwise monotonous task of visiting the ladies. Baboons and squirrels love to steal toilet paper; the squirrels use it for nesting, while the baboons use it to decorate surrounding trees. I can think of no logical motivation for this, although I suspect they enjoy watching me wade through mosquito-infested bush trying to fish the paper off of thorny branches with a broom.</p>, <p>Toilet paper is not the only item of interest in the loo. The mirrors attract plenty of visitors, and one in particular has drawn a great deal of attention from guests and staff alike. The Bradfield’s Hornbill, also known as the “Zazu bird,” regularly fails to distinguish his reflection in the mirror from a competing male. Nearly every day we watch several hornbills make the same error. The hornbill lands next to the sink, glares at the face staring back at him, and flies with fantastic confidence into the glass. Landing with a thud, he picks himself up, ruffles his feathers, and pauses only briefly before repeating the sad exercise.</p>, <p>Today a guest suggested that we ought to take pity on these birds by placing a curtain over the mirrors. This was not the first time I had heard this, and I agreed, that after nearly six months of watching what might be the same hornbill smash into a mirror, enough might be enough. Mirrors do not occur naturally in the wild, and it seemed unfair to leave our winged friends at the mercy of the looking glass. I was reminded of the numerous times I aimed at myself during a game of laser-tag. In the dark and smoke it appeared that I was face to face with the enemy. One painful shot later I would curse the damned mirror and myself for not recognizing that the enemy was, in fact, me.</p>, <p>The truth is, I have long felt a kinship with these birds, and not because I am awful at laser-tag. I may not be crashing into any glass, but I still curse the mirror and the reflection staring back at me. Is this the girl who forgot to order flour? Is this the girl who hid the remaining brownies from the guests, desperate for a chocolate fix, and then proceeded to eat all four? Is this the so-called professional who failed and broke down in in front of the staff, let tears fall in public and ran away like she was escaping a school yard fight?  Is this the history student with no cooking ability who thought she could manage a kitchen and seven chefs who expect a manager who knows what she is doing and not a foreigner who still forgets which side of the car the driver’s seat is on? There is the mirror, confirming that this mess of a person with hair gone wild is you, not some stranger who clearly needs a cup of strong coffee, or sleep, or jelly tots, or all three, for that matter.</p>, <p>A simple curtain is all the hornbill needs to leave his reflection alone. Kicking my bad habit is an ongoing project. A good friend told me when I started this job that no matter how terrible the crisis, or how badly I thought I had ruined everything, I could rest assured that someday soon we would laugh about it. Early in my days as a camp manager, it took several weeks at a time for me to gather the perspective that laughter requires. I don’t know if I will ever stop seeing the enemy in myself when things go wrong. Still, I can celebrate the fact that a year down the road it’s far less difficult to find humour in disaster. The hornbill throws himself at the mirror and winds up with a bruised beak. Self-deprecation hurts. It makes me wonder if it wouldn’t be easier to apply a little forgiveness.</p>, <p>Misguided and stubborn, the hornbill has become a sort of inspiration.

It was well past midnight and my water tanks were overflowing. The switches are located behind the kitchen, so, despite the lateness of the hour, I grabbed my flashlight and made my way back into camp. Rounding the corner where my pathway meets the entrance to the front of house, I briefly considered using the boardwalk to make the rest of journey. Foolishly, I decided that my footsteps might disturb the guests and continued through the woods. When a crash in the bushes caused my heart to stop beating momentarily, I sincerely regretted this error in judgment.</p>, <p>Instinctively, I shone my light towards the source of the noise. There I saw the body of an impala and I did not need to look for signs of blood to know that she was dead. I have followed this path enough to know that impala always flee when humans approach. I was, for the first time since I had arrived in Africa, afraid. This was not a familiar fear, like the type brought on by discovering a scorpion in my shower, by stepping out of the office to find an elephant blocking the way, or by flying in a small Cessna surrounded by lighting and ominous storm clouds. All these moments had made me uncomfortable and nervous, but I also knew on some level that I was safe. Standing next to this fresh kill at twilight, I was not so sure. The crash I had heard a few seconds earlier was the sound of a cat moving. This I was certain of. What now?</p>, <p>I could, for dramatic effect, recall the well-reasoned thought process I engaged in alone behind the camp laundry. Perhaps I remembered my training in encountering dangerous game. We were taught that when confronted by predators we should stay still, scan the area for other cats, shine a light at the animal, raise our voices, stand tall, and, if able to, take very slow steps backwards. Under no circumstances were we to run. This was the first and most serious instruction I was given when I started this job. I have been told not to run from predators so often that I would not be surprised if the instruction were to be permanently engrained in the synapses of my brain. Here I was faced with a situation I had imagined hundreds of times. I knew exactly what had to be done.</p>, <p>For at least several seconds I attempted to do as I had been told, but I was fighting a losing battle against an intense desire to do exactly the opposite. When I envisaged moments like this I always wondered whether I’d choose fight or flight, whether the will to run would be too strong, or whether I would have the good sense to stay put. Now I have my answer. I had barely set eyes on the carcass when I turned back and walked away with haste. One step. Two steps. I picked my feet up and began to run. I did not stop until I reached the front door of the closest management house. I stood there for half a minute, breathing deeply to calm myself, and then tiptoed home. My hands were shaking when I opened my door. Were it not for the sound of water hitting the ground to my right, I might have forgotten why I was outside in the first place. Convinced that all the money in the world would not persuade me to revisit the pump switches, I shut my water tanks off manually. When the maintenance manager arrived at my house at 5 am to turn them back on, I was informed that I had inadvertently cut off the entire camp’s water supply. Suffice it to say that I have had better days.</p>, <p>The next morning I surveyed the location of my embarrassing cowardice. Next to the dead impala were the tracks of a female leopard who had run in the other direction. As it turns out, she was likely more afraid than I. Standing on two feet I gave the impression of strength and prowess. I was the predator. This is why we are taught not to turn and run. Running is reserved for prey. Were I to have had the misfortune of interrupting a lion kill, and not that of such a timid cat, the outcome of my choice might have been very different. A pride of 16 lion have been moving near the camp for weeks now. I prefer not to consider fully the implications of my stupidity.</p>, <p>My midnight run-in and accidental water shut-off have quickly become a source of jest in camp. This particular leopard is shy, and the most unfortunate result of my ill-timed stroll was to ruin her supper. In an attempt to rectify my blunder, the guides moved the carcass further from camp in the hopes that our shy feline might be able to eat undisturbed. I laughed along with my colleagues when I shared the story and I’m sure I will again soon. Even so, I am left with a slightly unsettling feeling. I failed completely to obey the laws of the bush. I am acutely aware of how lucky I am and even more acutely aware of the shallowness of my courage. I have been living in my house on the lagoon for just over a year. It was four months before I was able to bring myself to walk home alone after dark. I see now that this was not bravery discovered. Just as it became easier to replenish depleted stocks and respond tactfully to unhappy clients, the significance of those four steps between the boardwalk and the ground faded.  Time will make even the most dangerous places safe.</p>, <p>I hesitated and stumbled in my attempts to write about this incident. I think I was hoping to extract some meaning from the experience beyond the immediate physical panic that I detected deep in the soles of my feet. I wanted to frame the encounter in the light of a year having passed since my arrival in this camp. I have failed on both accounts. The smell of rotting impala behind the laundry has finally dissipated and I’ve given up my search for nature’s latest lesson. The truth: After nearly two years spent living and working in Africa, I am still afraid of the dark and the glowing eyes that accompany it. This is not necessarily terrible; it may give me pause the next time I debate venturing into the thicket under the shroud of nightfall.</p>, <p>A second truth: I will, albeit carefully, continue to walk alone long after the sun has set. The distance between my front door and the security of the walkway has become a blessing. I relish the serenity of my small piece of paradise, away from the mania and worry of a busy camp. I am lulled to sleep by the sounds of the bull elephant sweeping Mangosteen berries from my deck and the calls of hyena in the distance. This past year has given me a greater sense of peace than I thought possible. While I am humbled by my tendency to run away when experience and reason should command me to stand still, these moments of fear and doubt are mitigated by the comfort I’ve uncovered in this dangerous territory. Last night my feet touched the soil again and I froze upon hearing another crash in the bushes beside me. Heart pounding, I turned to face a large male Kudu, his magnificent horns held high to the moonlight. We acknowledged each other as we often do, my pulse slowed by the recognition of this noble guardian. Alone in the dark, where the lion roamed and the leopard hunted, I was home, safe and sound.</p>]","[<p>

What makes green so bright that everything else appears dull and faded by comparison? The trees come alive and they beg of all smaller things to echo their call to renewed existence. The soil is trampled by the tiny hooves of newborns and the sound of single cicada is deafening. We sit on the deck with glasses of wine, mesmerized by the storm gathering on the horizon. Thunder and lightning stir us out of our waking slumber. The morning after the storm we touch down on hardened earth and feel the tickle of fresh shoots at our ankles. The world seems cleaner, and there is a comfort in knowing the clouds will continue to unleash rain upon us so we may be greeted by a different sunrise than the last. The dust of long days and heavy limbs will wash away. We know why others have danced in the rain before us, and the joy is palpable. The rainy season is breathtaking and these words will not do its overwhelming beauty justice.</p>, <p>I am astounded by the extent to which the environment has altered in the last few weeks. Only a few storms have graced us with their presence, and yet I am living in an Eden of thick greenery. All the concession’s inhabitants drink of the rain’s bounty. Masses of insects have descended. At dinnertime, we rush to move lanterns from the table before the termites swarm the light. After the first heavy rains, the flying termites leave their nests to mate. Within the space of an hour, the boardwalks will become a somber graveyard of wings, which are dropped as soon as the termites land on a surface that is suitably damp for the formation of a new nest. Of the thousands of termites who litter the ground, only a few will survive to create new colonies. We are content to eat in near total darkness, observing the madness of this yearly breeding ritual.</p>, <p>Rains paint the sky black all around us. The storms move quickly, making it difficult to predict the exact time that they will fall overhead. When the first storm hit a few evenings ago, I had to laugh at the futility of our response. Most of the rooms were soaked in minutes. Glasses smashed and chess pieces scattered the lounge before we could pull the flaps down and turn all the couches inwards. I stuffed dry towels into a garbage bag and delivered them to a few damp guests. One woman offered me space under her umbrella, but I was already drenched. Happy to walk through the rain, I was half-tempted to stick out my tongue to catch fresh drops of water.</p>, <p>This season has me filling the shoes of someone much younger, and I am not just thinking of the rainbow heart covered gumboots that I recently pulled out of cobwebs. Baby impala run and play, oblivious to the pack of wild dogs waiting patiently down the road. These young antelope are the favourite snack of all the area’s predators and nearly half of them will die before the season changes again. If they can relish the summer sun while danger licks its lips in anticipation of the next meal, who am I not to smile in the face of heady humidity and bugs that pounce on skittish guests? There is too much to be grateful for.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/december-wild-dog.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-58"" data-attachment-id=""58"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""8"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":""NIKON D90"",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""1322763345"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""200"",""iso"":""400"",""shutter_speed"":""0.02"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""December Wild Dog"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/december-wild-dog.jpg?w=750"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/december-wild-dog.jpg?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/december-wild-dog.jpg"" data-orig-size=""2144,1061"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2011/12/04/give-thanks/december-wild-dog/"" sizes=""(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/december-wild-dog.jpg?w=750&amp;h=371"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/december-wild-dog.jpg?w=750&amp;h=371 750w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/december-wild-dog.jpg?w=1500&amp;h=742 1500w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/december-wild-dog.jpg?w=150&amp;h=74 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/december-wild-dog.jpg?w=300&amp;h=148 300w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/december-wild-dog.jpg?w=768&amp;h=380 768w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/december-wild-dog.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=507 1024w"" title=""December Wild Dog""/></a></p>, <p>The year has come full circle. I arrived here last November at the start of the rainy season and remember vividly the first night I was lucky enough to witness a termite attack during dinner. Bugs were flying into open mouths and hair, and I can’t deny that a scream escaped my own lips when one flew down the back of my shirt.  As expected, several guests dashed away in disgust. The rest of us bonded around a table  strewn with squirming insects, fishing wings out of the lettuce and laughing at the almost Hitchcock-esque scene before us. Over twelve months have elapsed since that evening of initiation, and sometimes I feel as if I have barely had time to take stock of the items in my storeroom, let alone the year gone-by. I welcome then this sudden burst of growth that has given me pause to remember the seasons past and appreciate the cycle that sustains and transforms. Each time I wake up to find dew glistening on new shades of green, I quietly give thanks for a year spent in paradise.</p>]","[<p>

It’s true that December has always been the one month that we could all take time to congregate, and to let the noise of school or work be replaced by something more peaceful, familiar and comforting. It seemed right that this month fell during winter. As the school holiday drew closer, I would yearn for something warmer. My dad’s oversized wool socks, the smell of mom’s potato pancakes sizzling in the frying pan, my grandmother’s afghan and the corner of the couch it went so perfectly with; these were the pieces of home’s mosaic. It wasn’t complicated patchwork, but it made leaving bittersweet. I suspect that this will never change.</p>, <p>The usual December holiday cues are absent now. I haven’t seen snow in over two years and it’s been far too long since my mom and I indulged in our yearly winter tradition of watching The Sound of Music for the umpteenth time. Despite the shift in scenery, my mind has been recently adrift with images of home. Perhaps the animals are to blame, busy as they are expanding and nurturing families of their own. The woodland is ripe with the activity of new additions, adding a sense of urgency to my desire to get out of the office. They grow up quickly, when prying jaws do not snatch them up first.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/look-my-way.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-66"" data-attachment-id=""66"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""5.6"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":""NIKON D90"",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""1323092025"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""200"",""iso"":""400"",""shutter_speed"":""0.0005"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""Look My Way"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/look-my-way.jpg?w=750"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/look-my-way.jpg?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/look-my-way.jpg"" data-orig-size=""2144,1167"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2011/12/15/family/look-my-way/"" sizes=""(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/look-my-way.jpg?w=750&amp;h=408"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/look-my-way.jpg?w=750&amp;h=408 750w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/look-my-way.jpg?w=1500&amp;h=816 1500w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/look-my-way.jpg?w=150&amp;h=82 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/look-my-way.jpg?w=300&amp;h=163 300w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/look-my-way.jpg?w=768&amp;h=418 768w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/look-my-way.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=557 1024w"" title=""Look My Way""/></a></p>, <p>Returning from a brief afternoon drive, I saw warthogs with several babies who were barely a week old. I watched them run with tails turned up to the sky towards a glorious mud puddle just waiting to be wallowed in. We were quick to remark that they were playing hazardously close to the pride of lion less than a kilometer away. The cats had appeared committed to the all-consuming task of sleeping in the shade, and were thus (I hoped) too pre-occupied to bother with these tiny youngsters. We left the piglets to their frolicking, willing them aloud to avoid the feline filled thicket over the hill. A few days later, we passed a herd of impala along the airstrip road and attempted to spot the young ones, without whom the rainy season would be incomplete. They were nowhere to be found, and for a short moment I worried that they had already succumbed to the voracious appetites of the wild dogs. I breathed a sigh of relief when the guide pointed out the cluster of little legs hidden in the brush. There they were in the “nursery,” concealed from danger, at least temporarily. On both occasions I arrived back in camp feeling lighter than when I had left. No heavy heart or foul mood is immune to the endearing innocence of newborns. Watch a baby elephant struggle to lift its first branch with a trunk he is not yet accustomed to, and I promise you’ll laugh, remembering all the falls and scrapes of childhood, and the magic of first steps.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bye-piglets.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-67"" data-attachment-id=""67"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""5.6"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":""NIKON D90"",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""1323092297"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""200"",""iso"":""640"",""shutter_speed"":""0.00025"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""Bye Piglets"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bye-piglets.jpg?w=750"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bye-piglets.jpg?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bye-piglets.jpg"" data-orig-size=""2144,1108"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2011/12/15/family/bye-piglets/"" sizes=""(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bye-piglets.jpg?w=750&amp;h=387"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bye-piglets.jpg?w=750&amp;h=387 750w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bye-piglets.jpg?w=1498&amp;h=774 1498w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bye-piglets.jpg?w=150&amp;h=78 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bye-piglets.jpg?w=300&amp;h=155 300w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bye-piglets.jpg?w=768&amp;h=397 768w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/bye-piglets.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=529 1024w"" title=""Bye Piglets""/></a></p>, <p>With no small thanks to the emergence of all things green and new, December remains as wonderful as in years past, albeit dotted by pangs of isolation from what used to be. Were I to claim that I never longed to go back there, to sink into those soft cushions, I’d be lying. Is it possible to be homesick and still feel at home? If my introduction to the wild has taught me anything, it’s that a home is often mobile. When the hunt begins, the den has to move. Then there are those who keep returning to us, despite their skittishness upon being discovered. The leopard that stalks between tents and the kudu that huddle by our boardwalks when storms descend. I’ve been told that they are seeking safety here. I can’t say that I’m much different. Instinct tells us where we need to stay and when we should change direction. That’s what makes it okay to miss it all and to acknowledge the doubt surrounding my choices. Few leaps are taken without missteps and glances to the path not taken. This December is markedly different than the others, but I believe my feet are planted in the right spot. I’m thinking of family today, wishing I was home and reassured by the inkling that I might already be there.</p>]","[<p>

Yesterday, for example, seemed designed to test the limits of my self-control. The morning dawned full of promise, until a visit to the cold room revealed that there was no butter. After asking two pilots (a.k.a wonderful friends and frequent life-savers) to buy me butter at the grocery store so that I could avoid admitting to the office that I ran out of a basic commodity three days after freight was delivered, I decided to risk shame and go through the proper channels. What ensued was a stuttered attempt to justify my order by offering the following professional explanation: “these guests really like to eat butter.” Brunch was the next stop. As we were serving lamb, I had the chef make a special chicken dish for a vegetarian guest. Yes, I know, chicken is not a vegetable. This dawned on me while I gave the waitresses instructions to “serve the chicken to the lady who doesn’t eat meat.” A slightly embarrassing misstep, but one that also served to make the otherwise tired chef and me laugh at my total ineptitude. The morning wound down as I unpacked a box of rotten broccoli (that’s generally what happens to broccoli when it sits in the warehouse for four days, waiting for a seat on an airplane). There I was, checking in rotten vegetables, counting pork-chops and discovering that they had sent me five times what I ordered- fifty chops for four guests- willing myself to imagine the calm that was beckoning on the other side of next week.</p>, <p>I will be the first to admit that these bumps in the road are minor. They are troublesome enough to cast a shadow on an easy, uneventful day, but they are not problems worth more than a despondent sigh. Within a few hours of the chicken incident, things were already looking up. By some supply miracle, eight fresh sticks of butter arrived the same afternoon. After a tea so delicious that one guest came back for second and third servings of cake, the camp choir put on an impromptu afternoon performance for a family with young children. The singing lifted my mood and spirit, like it always does. I was reminded of other happy hours passed in camp, the ones that make three months of continuous work worthwhile.</p>, <p>Up until this point, my writing has centered on wildlife and the surrounding environment. The wild is certainly what drew me to this job, but food is what has become the primary focus of my life here. I should note that I was the one member of the family who always tried to avoid cooking or baking, and preferred sitting on the couch until it came time to ask my sister to eat the leftover banana bread batter, or pick at all of my mom’s cooking before she was finished. I was particularly scarce when it came time to clean the kitchen…Strange then that my days now revolve around food. If I’m not ordering food, I’m tasting food, counting food, fretting and sometimes crying over food. On rare occasions I am even allowed to make a bit of food, though I have not progressed past cookies, and I have to hand them over to someone more experienced before they are baked. Our oven has no temperature dial and I do not possess what can only be described as a magical ability to gage the heat and timing required for anything from biscotti to a leg of lamb.</p>, <p>The kitchen is often the loudest place in the camp. Waiters are busy loading the cart, brunch is late, or we are down to our last carton of milk. Cakes flop, eggs break, and the Panna cotta melts into a sloppy mess before reaching the table. A lot can go wrong in that room, and yet, my happy spot is there, on top of the waiter’s trunk along the back wall. If I’m lucky, I can sit on the trunk for a few minutes while I’m waiting to unload freight or issue stock, and watch the chefs at work. P is preparing icing for a carrot cake, folding butter, cream cheese and icing sugar together to craft something decadent and delicious from the simplest of ingredients. K is cutting small cheese biscuits and their savoury scent is permeating all corners of the room. N is kneading bread dough, swaying just slightly up and down, focused and engrossed in the task at hand. Flour and yeast are molded into steaming, comforting sustenance. Slathered with butter, dipped in soup, and perfect for making sandwiches after everyone else has gone to sleep, the bread baked here is everyone’s favourite. I try to avoid indulging in it, and truthfully, the sight of practiced hands working dough is nourishment enough. In these rare moments of peaceful observation, I daydream about our kitchen at home, and the joy of watching my father bake bread. Inhaling the familiar smell, everything is quiet and okay.</p>, <p>When I decided to move here, it was for elephants and sunsets, and I gave little thought to the job I’d be taking to make it happen. 95 days is a long time to stay in one place without a real day off. Minutes and hours of total panic are interspersed with dull stretches of absolutely nothing. We are listless or exhausted, eager for more to do or yearning for a break. When I see a hippo amble down the path just after dawn, or photograph a kingfisher as it hovers over the channel, I know immediately that I wouldn’t trade this existence for the luxury of weekends and restaurants. Then I steal a few minutes in my treasured corner of the kitchen, and am comforted and inspired by all the busy acts of creation that take place there. I want to create something too, however small. That wonderful things can begin with a little flour and willing hands reminds me that there is still time and a chance to figure out how to make something of myself. Trial, error and kind chefs have taught me a great deal about how to manage a successful kitchen, but no other lesson has made so marked an impact. I love living in the middle of a veritable Eden. This living, breathing paradise provides all of us with an opportunity to grasp onto happiness and wonder. On the cusp of a new year that may very well be my last in the bush, I am no longer surprised at the extent to which a hot and smoky kitchen can do the same.</p>]","[<p>

I remember the day C and I ordered in lunch and dinner on the same day, because we could not put down <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em>, even to make a sandwich. We sat at opposite ends of the couch, her twenty pages ahead of me and trying not to gasp and sigh too loudly, lest she give anything away too soon. Packing books for my move to Africa, I picked up my late grandfather’s beaten copy of <em>Sons and Lovers</em> from the basement bookshelf, and the beauty of D.H. Lawrence’s words left me stunned and afraid.  Before and in between the textbooks and highlighters, laptops and essays, CVs and failed applications, elephants and food orders, there were these books that I read because I wanted to read them. There were the moments I detected some sense of shared emotion and experience on the pages in front of me. There was the rush to record lines I was certain I would want to return to later, when the words had faded from memory, but the impact of the story and its passages remained.</p>, <p>In a whirl of total naivety, I sent an entire bag of books to Botswana, believing that I would spend hours a day reading.  If I could give my past-self some travel advice, I would tell her to save the shipping costs. Since moving here last November I have not read a single book from beginning to end. By the time I trudged into my house at the end of the day all I wanted to do was sleep or watch TV. When I did pick up a book, I fought the urge to close my eyes after a few pages. All the books I carefully selected for life in the wilderness gathered dust, and after a few months most of them were locked away in my trunk. I kept a small collection on my bedside table, but they served a largely decorative purpose. At least this tent looked like it belonged to someone who read, and not like the tent of a girl who could barely get through her exercise video, let alone finish a novel.</p>, <p>Then I found myself on the beach in Mozambique, book in hand. It was a book I had started over four months ago and had been unable to finish, until now. When it was done, I moved on to my Kindle. In predictable fashion, I had purchased at least 20 books when I received it, but had not read more than a page or two. Suddenly I found myself unable to stop. I kept the Kindle with me at all times. I carried it to the table for breakfast, to the beach, to dinner, to the bedroom and back. I read it while I waited for Pina Colada’s at the Casbah Beach Bar; I read it while fresh calamari was sizzling on the stove; I read it lounging under the hot sun; I read it on the airplane, oblivious to the fact that I was severely afraid of flying. I was slightly anti-social at times, and I was moved to tears more than once. It was perfect.</p>, <p>This holiday was wonderful for so many reasons. I was with good friends. Despite my professed fear of any food served with eyeballs still intact, I tried my first prawn dipped in delicious hot butter and proceeded to eat more prawns, order a second plate of prawns, and continue to eat prawns nearly every day. I touched the sand and floated in an ocean clear as glass. I learned to play poker and instituted a no-morning alarm rule. Work was finally a little farther away. There were discussions about timelines and careers and homesickness, but most hours were happily spent laughing and playing, with stomachs full and skin a little sunburned. With the trip winding to a close, I read more voraciously, trying to soak up every minute of indulgent bliss.</p>, <p>Living here involves a degree of isolation from friends and family that is not always easy to accept. I faced the return to work with trepidation, half disappointed when I saw my name on the flight schedule to travel to camp. Walking back into my empty, squirrel tousled tent yesterday, I was relieved to recognize the four walls and tin roof as home, however remote and lonely it might appear to the outsider, and to myself on difficult days. I placed the Kindle on the dusty stack of unread books next to the bed and wondered what had changed. Something has undoubtedly altered, perhaps in my outlook on this strange existence, but I am not yet able to pinpoint it. For now, pages are beckoning with greater urgency – the blank ones I hope to fill and the bound ones that have welcomed me back like an old friend met after a lengthy absence.</p>, <p><strong>Holiday Reading List:</strong></p>, <p><em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em>, Milan Kundera</p>, <p><em>The Book Thief</em>, Markus Zusak</p>, <p><em>The History of History</em>, Ida Hattemer-Higgins</p>, <p><em>The Elegance of the Hedgehog</em>, Muriel Barbery</p>, <p><em>The Marriage Plot</em>, Jeffrey Eugenides</p>, <p>I am currently reading <em>The Corrections</em>, by Jonathan Franzen. The desire to choose sleep and TV series over books is fast returning, but I will not judge myself too harshly this time around.</p>]","[<p>

Are dreams and wishes woven from the same thread? I want to succeed at my job; this is certainly a pressing goal. I want to photograph a bird in flight. I want sharp lines to border hues that shine on the screen as my eyes remember them. I want to work at something I love, not because it’s necessary, but because I would be saddened were the pursuit absent from my existence.</p>, <p>These sorts of musings never perplexed me when I was younger. I passed through a rotating carousel of aspirations with ease. First was teacher, and I spent more than one afternoon “teaching” a row of stuffed animal in my bedroom. I toyed with the idea of secretary and cashier often, but this was mainly due to my fascination with punching receipts and pretending to answer a phone. Such were the simple pleasures of childhood imagination. Veterinarian took up residence in the dream box for several years, and led to at least one inspired Dr. Doolittle book report. This fizzled when I realized that not only did vets have to euthanize animals, but I was also more interested in having a dog than operating on one. My parents adopted Barney, our slightly crazed and entirely loveable Pointer/Beagle/Hound mix, and my dreams of veterinary-hood stalled. This is where memory fades, because I cannot recall wanting anything with much fervor after that.</p>, <p>It was at this time that goals surpassed dreams on my priority list. There were assignments and grades, and these provided me with sufficient markers to aim for. I had no idea what I wanted to “be” when I grew up. I chose courses and programs in order to stay on a track leading to nowhere in particular, until I found myself sitting in an empty room in Botswana with an acceptance notice to a professional program and the sharp recognition that I felt nothing close to gladness. Where was the familiar excitement and relief at having reached the latest finish line? It appeared that the race was no longer enough. Here I was, a grown up, who still did not know what or who I wanted to be. The one thing that I was sure of was <em>where</em> I wanted to be, which is why I’m typing this from a thatched office frequented by baby squirrels and visited occasionally by elephants. When I chose this spot I understood what those lucky souls meant when they professed to have always known what it was they wanted to do. I was happy. I am happy.</p>, <p>Of course it is in my nature to sabotage contentment, to the point that I wonder if I will ever function properly without worry to fill the twilight space between exhaustion and dreaming. I am highly skilled at spinning when I should be sleeping and count needless queries like sheep. Will food spending be over budget <em>again</em> this month? Will I remember to organize the hard-boiled eggs for Mrs. Smith’s breakfast? Will room 5 blow an air-horn if they find a spider in their mosquito net again? How many days before we run out milk? Can I <em>milk </em>an impala? Then the question that has always loomed reveals itself with force. What do I do next?</p>, <p>I don’t profess to know or believe if there is any sense in willing dreams to come true, but I remember fondly the one day reserved for falling under such fantasy. When the time came each year to make a wish over the candles of my homemade chocolate birthday cake, I closed my eyes, and asked the birthday fairies, gods, or sentient beings, to grant me the gift of flight. Yes. Once a year, far past the age when it was endearing to long for Marvel style super-powers, I wished I could fly. As you first begin to dream, you don’t worry about whether or not your dreams will come true; you just dream big. You think about what you would most love to do, or see, or be, and you wish for it.</p>, <p>It seems that I could use a few birthday candles now.</p>, <p>Children wish for the impossible without hesitation. Why is it so much more difficult to acknowledge wishes that are within reach? I’ve known for a long time exactly what I want. Maybe if I was standing over a birthday cake I’d be able to wish for it without being afraid of failing. I grew up and started writing lists and setting goals, and I think I gave up on dreaming too soon. The thing is, I detect an expiry date on this journey without destination. Life here is exactly as it should be. If I knew then what I do today, I would have wished for these past two years when I blew the candles out. Still, the other dream is waiting, and I cannot let it idle much longer.</p>, <p>I remain terrified as ever. It feels a little like asking to fly, and I’ve decided that this is okay. I might never capture flight in focus, but I’ll keep trying. I’ll forgo the goals and time line and finish line for something blurred and difficult to grasp, because it’s what I want more than anything. I hope that it isn’t too late to shut my eyes and steal a moment for wishing.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fisheagle.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-85"" data-attachment-id=""85"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""8"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":""NIKON D90"",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""1314639819"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""200"",""iso"":""400"",""shutter_speed"":""0.003125"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""FishEagle"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fisheagle.jpg?w=750"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fisheagle.jpg?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fisheagle.jpg"" data-orig-size=""2144,1424"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2012/02/23/i-wished-i-could-fly/fisheagle/"" sizes=""(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fisheagle.jpg?w=750&amp;h=498"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fisheagle.jpg?w=750&amp;h=498 750w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fisheagle.jpg?w=1500&amp;h=996 1500w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fisheagle.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fisheagle.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199 300w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fisheagle.jpg?w=768&amp;h=510 768w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/fisheagle.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=680 1024w"" title=""FishEagle""/></a></p>]","[<p>

It was that crisp, familiar scent of fall on pavement. It was the smell of the first week of October, of walking the dog, or opening the deck door of #87 on a lazy Sunday to find dad reading outside, the forest before him. I looked down and saw green leaves strewn about the ground; it was certainly still summer here. I wanted to step on orange and auburn maple leaves, to hear them crunching beneath my feet. So I allowed myself a few minutes to miss it all. I would soon be busy sorting out staff issues and signing out mosquito coils and washing powder. Then I had to contend with feeding 17 male guests whose particularly fondness for omelets was quickly leading to what would be my umpteenth breakfast stock crisis. Inhaling the scent of autumn leaves, I wanted to go somewhere far away.</p>, <p>There between the dry stores, standing on scarred cement, I forgot the kitchen and imagined sitting at the purple granite counter top where we read the paper and drank coffee in the morning. I was wearing my favourite jeans and walking on a sidewalk covered with the remnants of springtime bloom. The trees were not yet bare; they were a warm palate of sunset hues, littering the ground as a paintbrush spattered lovingly on an artist’s canvas. Blown about by wind and increasing cold, the colours wrap us in the glow of the harvest season for a few fleeting days, until they crumple to charred debris, readied for their burial in glittering snow. From one beauty to another, all things pass away in time.</p>, <p>Then the silent nostalgia was interrupted by life carrying on as usual. The food order was waiting and the guests were arriving for tea. I returned to my desk tired and in no mood to calculate chicken punnet quantities. I was thus hunched over the keyboard engaged in a slow rhythm of procrastination when I heard the unmistakable sound of elephants trumpeting in the distance. P came to tell us that a herd was moving towards the water, just by my house. Had you described the scene to me several years ago, I would have been shocked to hear that anyone, upon hearing this news, would stay put. There I was, feeling too tired to bother. I’m not sure why I changed my mind. I suppose the cloud of frustration and burnout lifted just long enough for me to gather my senses and my camera in a hurry. For this I am grateful.</p>, <p>I found P on the boardwalk, standing still and facing three elephants. There were two juveniles with tusks barely protruding, accompanied by a large female. The lens cap was off before I arrived and I set about trying to photograph the scene despite the obviously insufficient light. After a few minutes spent pointlessly fumbling with camera settings, I accepted that this was not the time to worry about documentation and sat down. The young elephant was directly in front of me, busy eating his way through the greenery. I felt safe and completely shaken. I wanted to thank them, because earlier that day I had toyed with the thought of leaving. I was missing everything and everyone. I was longing to fold up the khakis and find my way to a new season. These giants had other ideas.</p>, <p>I will never forget the first time I met an elephant. I was twelve years old, on my first trip to Africa. We had been driving for hours through pounding rain when we came upon them. A great mass of grey and ivory stood firm against the storm. I could barely see through the water-smudged lenses of my glasses, but I cried, so overcome with the emotion of being this close to an animal I had loved since the first of many viewings of Babar. I’m sure this was the moment I first hitched my heart to the grasses and channels of Botswana.</p>, <p>Elephants were the great beasts of my childhood imagining; they embodied the Africa I dreamed of. I decided two years ago that if there ever came a day that I was not elated by their presence, I would pack my bags. Since arriving in camp last month, I’ve only caught glimpses between overgrown branches. The greenery has overwhelmed, causing my eyes to water and my sense of purpose to drift out of reach. As if to comfort a weary soul, the leaves are beginning to fall and the herds are returning to feed. It is dark now and the elephants may still be blocking the way home. I could try and sneak past them, but I’d rather stay a while.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/peekingelephant.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-102"" data-attachment-id=""102"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""5.6"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":""NIKON D90"",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""1329820616"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""112"",""iso"":""800"",""shutter_speed"":""0.004"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""PeekingElephant"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/peekingelephant.jpg?w=750"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/peekingelephant.jpg?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/peekingelephant.jpg"" data-orig-size=""2144,1424"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2012/03/04/stay/peekingelephant/"" sizes=""(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/peekingelephant.jpg?w=750&amp;h=498"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/peekingelephant.jpg?w=750&amp;h=498 750w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/peekingelephant.jpg?w=1500&amp;h=996 1500w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/peekingelephant.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/peekingelephant.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199 300w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/peekingelephant.jpg?w=768&amp;h=510 768w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/peekingelephant.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=680 1024w"" title=""PeekingElephant""/></a></p>]","[<p>

I grabbed my torch instinctively and looked through the house, as the high-pitched squeals closed in on my cocoon of canvas and wood. The shrieking and screaming were of such a strange quality that I was able to easily eliminate the usual suspect: squirrels, hippos and elephants. My search revealed nothing suspicious and I was just about to crawl back under the covers when I pinpointed the source of the nightmarish calls. Peering though the thin mesh of netting I discovered at least six honey badgers chasing each other in furious circles on my deck.</p>, <p>These typically solitary creatures were gathering to fight for a female. I watched the bizarre mating ritual in fascination, though it was difficult to distinguish winner from loser. The battle chorus was disturbing and wonderful all at once. This was only my third honey badger sighting. I had last seen one while walking a guest to his tent. I stopped to wait for the badger to run off the boardwalk, hesitant to cross his path. These animals have a vicious reputation; more than one lion has mistaken a honey badger for easy prey, only to find himself bit in the face. Now half a dozen of these mad mammals were fighting next to my door. I shone my torch on them momentarily to catch a better glimpse and I am almost certain that this was what elicited the next round of screaming. I jumped back into bed to avoid interrupting them further. Restless with curiosity, (and unable to sleep amidst the deafening calls) I returned to the door several times. I may have even asked aloud: “What is so interesting about my deck?” I was, after all, exhausted, and hoping for a few hours of rest before the sun rose.</p>, <p>A few nights later I was escorting two guests to their tent when the thrust of African darkness presented itself in the flesh. I stopped dead in my tracks halfway between the boardwalk junction and the door and watched a leopard leap from its crouching place in front of me. Instinct told me to run, as it did each time I found myself in the company of predators and other aggressors. With guests standing directly behind me, my feet must have sensed that instinct had to be suppressed. We took a few steps back and waited. When the guide returned, we approached the tent slowly to find the cat, and I spotted it crossing from the shrubbery to the floodplain in front of the verandah. We gazed into the blackness together, sharing a few minutes of utter wonder.</p>, <p>Leaving the guests secure inside the tent I felt like shouting to the sky. My blood pumped with vigor and the force of adrenaline carried my feet weightlessly across the same planks the leopard had stood upon. A hundred frustrating afternoons of delayed flights, lost sleep and guest complaints were erased. I see a leopard stalk and I understand the power and perfection contained in life’s movement. Each limb dances in effortless motion until halted by a split-second connection with the earth that catches the fluid energy of her body in beautiful suspension and propels her onwards. Her presence is ephemeral, but so stirring that I find sleep unattainable. I lie awake, ears piqued to detect another roar or trumpet. I savour the sounds that permeate a solitude that has never been wholly real. How many leopards have I passed without noticing? How many birds fluttered golden wings, unviewed?</p>, <p>Both nights left me sleep-deprived and gratefully invigorated. I treasure these signs of the camp’s wildness. Hours of office dwelling and administrative work cause us to forget where we are. Twilight encounters with leopards burrow in the far reaches of our consciousness and we walk as if these woods are not teeming with danger. I want the kingdom of hunters to grip me and toss me into unrest. I want to breathe in the awareness of my own finiteness in the vast biome. I will shudder in the shadow of giants, because this is as it was intended.</p>, <p>An elephant passed through camp this afternoon. I followed him with my camera from one patch of light to another, marveling at the artistry of a setting sun. Will I remember how small I felt with his eyes upon me? Sitting in an office while everyone else is sleeping, part of me fears the inevitable walk home through brush that hides dangerous possibility. Then I hear a hyaena howling in the distance and suddenly I know what I will miss most when I leave this place. I will hunger for the vulnerability of living amongst the mighty. I will listen in vain for the sounds of fighting in the darkness. I will sleep, wrapped in the safety of quiet insulation, dreaming of a faraway land that is both frightening and magnificent.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eleinthesun.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-109"" data-attachment-id=""109"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""5.6"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":""NIKON D90"",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""1331749279"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""200"",""iso"":""2000"",""shutter_speed"":""0.0125"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""EleintheSun"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eleinthesun.jpg?w=750"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eleinthesun.jpg?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eleinthesun.jpg"" data-orig-size=""2144,1424"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2012/03/15/shaken/eleinthesun/"" sizes=""(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eleinthesun.jpg?w=750&amp;h=498"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eleinthesun.jpg?w=750&amp;h=498 750w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eleinthesun.jpg?w=1500&amp;h=996 1500w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eleinthesun.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eleinthesun.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199 300w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eleinthesun.jpg?w=768&amp;h=510 768w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eleinthesun.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=680 1024w"" title=""EleintheSun""/></a></p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/shadesofgray.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-110"" data-attachment-id=""110"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""5.6"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":""NIKON D90"",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""1331749444"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""200"",""iso"":""2000"",""shutter_speed"":""0.02"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""ShadesofGray"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/shadesofgray.jpg?w=750"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/shadesofgray.jpg?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/shadesofgray.jpg"" data-orig-size=""2144,1424"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2012/03/15/shaken/shadesofgray/"" sizes=""(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/shadesofgray.jpg?w=750&amp;h=498"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/shadesofgray.jpg?w=750&amp;h=498 750w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/shadesofgray.jpg?w=1500&amp;h=996 1500w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/shadesofgray.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/shadesofgray.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199 300w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/shadesofgray.jpg?w=768&amp;h=510 768w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/shadesofgray.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=680 1024w"" title=""ShadesofGray""/></a></p>]","[<p>

The sun steals the warmth hidden in each crevice of drying earth. That blazing star sets and the darkness descends, faster than I remember. Canvas lets everything through its threads and the day’s precious heat escapes past the tin over my head. I unlock the trunk and remove the necessary items: wool to sleep in, mittens, hats, knitted sweaters and scarves: colours to brighten otherwise bleak evenings. The soles of my shoes are slightly charred and ready for more late night sojourns by the fire. We will play a game of touch and go, the flames and I. How long can I dig my heels into hot sand before they burn? My toes have thawed, but only just. A minute longer, I say, while smoke billows up from glowing coals. The scent of ashes will find me and settle there, constant as dust. We are sinking in softened sand, eyes stung by dirt and the bittersweet farewell to summer.</p>, <p>In April I saw the dog pack rip apart a young kudu next to the office. I left my coffee on the desk and jumped into the vehicle with my camera to photograph their bloody faces. I recalled how they looked as puppies last winter, playing on the banks of the channel. This April they were hunters, furious and strong. I sat in this seat a year ago and laughed while they tumbled in the grass on unsteady feet. One year was enough for a newborn to enter adulthood, teeth bared and ready to kill. Where was I?</p>, <p>I imagined I might be grown by now. I imagined I might be stronger and wiser. I imagined I might be inhabiting a life that I no longer recognize. I would open the door to a home and hear the voice of someone (I wonder if we have yet to meet). I dream of a thousand lines of prose, sleeping next to blank pages tucked in the bedside table for a better day. I want to describe the slow death of green that this month has wrought. I want to paint a scene of red dust and the sharp crunch of bone. I am hungry for it, but my eyes are heavy, so I reach for a book and a story that will ease the dull apathy brought on by the season.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/kudukill42.jpg""><img alt=""Image"" class=""size-full wp-image"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/kudukill42.jpg?w=1014""/></a></p>, <p>Another April has passed. I am going home soon, and while I am away the dogs will den again, to raise a new litter of eager predators. I am in awe of them, and their capacity to carry on with unrelenting vigour. Each day brings torn flesh and brilliant life wrapped in strange union. The dogs force me to admit that I seldom exist with such intensity. That said, I am suddenly acutely aware that my twenty fifth April has come and gone. I have tripped over phrases and false starts, but May holds some promise. I won’t punish myself for these few weeks of absence and quiet. Instead, I will defer to the work of another. How comforting it is to know that the lines we read and forget lie ready to infuse the spirit when we are most needy for inspiration.</p>, <p><em>There will be time, there will be time </em></p>, <p><em>To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet; </em></p>, <p><em>There will be time to murder and create, </em></p>, <p><em>And time for all the works and days of hands </em></p>, <p><em>That lift and drop a question on your plate;</em><em>       </em><em> </em></p>, <p><em>Time for you and time for me, </em></p>, <p><em>And time yet for a hundred indecisions, </em></p>, <p><em>And for a hundred visions and revisions, </em></p>, <p><em>Before the taking of a toast and tea.</em></p>, <p><em>– T.S.

I gingerly reached through the mosquito net for the radio, assuming she would be reporting on a disaster of epic proportions. Had a rogue baboon pilfered the wine store? Had the ants progressed from attacking the contents of the tea station to preying on humans? I am going on leave in a few days, and owing to my impatience, have resigned myself to the tedious and illogical anticipation of the next crisis. I was thus both surprised and overjoyed to hear C’s answer: “George is back.”</p>, <p>I’ve said before that we do not name animals here. We are told to avoid such a practice, lest we give the impression that this is some sort of zoo. These animals are wild. There are no fences or borders, and they wander freely, driven by hunger, fear of predators and the quest for dominance. We will name prides and packs for the sake of identification, with titles that are normally derived from geography or visible physical marks, like torn ears and crooked teeth.</p>, <p>It is easier to remain distant from a nameless beast. We quietly mourn the loss of new lion cubs to hyenas, and the sad end of a wild dog puppy at the jaws of a lion, but we are also aware that these deaths are tethered to the natural ebb and flow of balanced existence. I will celebrate if an impala deftly avoids the leopard’s claws, just as I will be overwhelmed by excitement when privy to a cat’s successful hunt. All of it, the bloodshed and the quick escape, is survival. I am an avid observer, but I try to remain unattached to the fates of the animals I meet, accepting that they are destined to fall before they even grace us with their presence. Then, of course, there is George.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/georgeandme.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-139"" data-attachment-id=""139"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""4.5"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":""NIKON D90"",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""1318615563"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""44"",""iso"":""400"",""shutter_speed"":""0.01"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""George and me"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/georgeandme.jpg?w=750"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/georgeandme.jpg?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/georgeandme.jpg"" data-orig-size=""2144,1362"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2012/05/13/for-george/georgeandme/"" sizes=""(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/georgeandme.jpg?w=750&amp;h=476"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/georgeandme.jpg?w=750&amp;h=476 750w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/georgeandme.jpg?w=1500&amp;h=952 1500w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/georgeandme.jpg?w=150&amp;h=95 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/georgeandme.jpg?w=300&amp;h=191 300w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/georgeandme.jpg?w=768&amp;h=488 768w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/georgeandme.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=651 1024w"" title=""George and me""/></a></p>, <p>George is an old bull elephant who has been visiting this camp for over a decade. He bears the unmistakable mark of injury: a deep hole in his forehead above his left eye. He will spend hours half-submerged in the lagoon in front of camp, eating the soft reeds that thrive in the water there. Elephants grow up to six new sets of teeth as they mature, and George is using his last. His teeth are weathered and he eats with painstaking effort in an attempt to take in the nutrients he needs. One day his teeth will be so worn or damaged that he will become malnourished, and this is likely what will kill him. Even the mighty king of the wilderness cannot withstand starvation.</p>, <p>For years guides have predicted his death. When I moved to the camp, I heard about him and wondered if I had arrived too late. It was summer and he was wandering amongst far away trees, perhaps taking a path he has known all his life. In May the earth began to dry and I was grateful to witness his arrival. He spent his days feeding in the water and sleeping against the giant Mangosteens that shade our boardwalks. Sometimes we watched him pull down branches as the other bulls did, but it always seemed that most of the leaves fell to the ground. His movements were laboured and he rarely broke a railing or disturbed the humans who surrounded him. Weeks passed and the distance between us lessened. I addressed him by name and as the words danced in the cold air before me I understood that I was no longer an observer. I cared deeply about his survival.</p>, <p>The October heat descended on a scorched landscape of brittle branches and dust and George departed. I thought of him often, and hoped that despite his age, he would return when the seasons changed. In April the elephant bulls took up residence in camp and we stopped to examine each grey face that passed overhead in search of our old and tired friend. A month went by and I had to consider the likely possibility that this time, he was gone forever. That is, until I woke up to hear C’s voice on the radio.</p>, <p>“George is back.” I wrapped the camera in one of my winter scarves and rushed to work happier than the day before. After the meeting I went to find him. I followed an elephant traipsing through the brush by the outdoor sala of room one. He was walking towards my house, and I waited for him on the balcony, and then on the floodplain past my water tower. I greeted him and wanted so desperately to gaze into those eyes, but he never turned his tusks towards me. While I cannot be certain that it was George, the news that he is here is comfort enough.</p>, <p>I left him standing alone against a backdrop whose beauty I had nearly dismissed in my rush to go. I will leave this place soon. It is a fact I can no longer deny as it creeps through the floorboards of the tent I call home. When I imagined goodbye I was heartbroken. Today is different. Today I thought I saw George again and I remembered that farewells are not finite. In my dreams, words, and imagining, I will find my way back.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/george.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-140"" data-attachment-id=""140"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""5.6"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":""NIKON D90"",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""1336810707"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""200"",""iso"":""800"",""shutter_speed"":""0.0008"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""George"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/george.jpg?w=750"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/george.jpg?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/george.jpg"" data-orig-size=""2144,1170"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2012/05/13/for-george/george/"" sizes=""(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/george.jpg?w=750&amp;h=409"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/george.jpg?w=750&amp;h=409 750w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/george.jpg?w=1500&amp;h=818 1500w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/george.jpg?w=150&amp;h=82 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/george.jpg?w=300&amp;h=164 300w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/george.jpg?w=768&amp;h=419 768w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/george.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=559 1024w"" title=""George""/></a></p>, <p>A few years from now, someone will ask me what it was like to live in Africa, and the question will evoke the memory of early morning mist over the banks of the Linyanti, the soft footsteps of giants, and the expanse of a magnificent space that cannot be broken by time or death.</p>]","[<p>

It was summer and my sister and I had nowhere in particular to go. We raced to Storybook Gardens an hour before it closed, to revisit the giant shoe belonging, of course, to the Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe. We swore the peacocks were giving us menacing looks. At some point we went to the mall and took silly pictures. I know my sister drove, because I have no sense of direction and need to be told ten minutes in advance whether I will be turning right or left. Understandably this annoys her slightly.</p>, <p>For two years I have glanced up at these photos during odd moments, reminded of a distant time and place. I was (I am) living amidst undeniable magic, but that did not always diminish the pull of home. I was sitting at my desk the day I learned that B was having a baby and I felt it. I was perched on the worn wicker chair when I opened photos of my sister’s graduation and I felt it again. A few weeks ago I listened to the voice on the other end of the phone and wished I could just close my eyes and be there. I’ll come back soon, I thought, but tonight it hurts to be so far away.</p>, <p>In just over a month I will be there. My time in Botswana is winding to an end and I wonder if I will recall all the days that passed as clearly as I remember laughing with my sister in a dusty photo booth. Each time I look up and catch a glimpse of our faces, eyes scrunched tight because we were overcome with a serious case of the giggles, I am both painfully aware of how rarely I see her now and also smirking at the ridiculous melody of our happy adventures.</p>, <p>Tomorrow I will look for my name on the plane schedule and pack the remainder of my things into a canvas bag. Before I leave the office for the last time, I’ll carefully take down my treasured photos. They are torn and yellowed at the edges now, but I cannot go without them.</p>, <p>I try not to dwell on what comes next, fearing it might lessen the joy with which I plan to inhabit the next four weeks. Yet, despite my best attempts, I sometimes allow myself to doze off dreaming about what the future contains. I envision a desk in an apartment somewhere, scattered with papers and unfinished stories. I imagine lifting my eyes from the keyboard to see a framed photo of a lion cub trying to stalk a mongoose on a fallen tree. I will immediately hear the sound of a camera clicking furiously under the glare of setting sun. The sensation of delight that comes from watching a young hunter at play will return to me and cause my heart to swell at the memory. Then I suspect tears will sting my eyes, because it hurts to be so far away.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/littlelion1.jpg""><img alt="""" class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-158"" data-attachment-id=""158"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""5.6"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":""NIKON D90"",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""1343757599"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""130"",""iso"":""3200"",""shutter_speed"":""0.003125"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""Little Lion"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/littlelion1.jpg?w=750"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/littlelion1.jpg?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/littlelion1.jpg"" data-orig-size=""2144,1424"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2012/09/01/favourite-photographs/littlelion-2/"" sizes=""(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/littlelion1.jpg?w=750&amp;h=498"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/littlelion1.jpg?w=750&amp;h=498 750w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/littlelion1.jpg?w=1500&amp;h=996 1500w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/littlelion1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/littlelion1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199 300w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/littlelion1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=510 768w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/littlelion1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=680 1024w"" title=""Little Lion""/></a></p>]","[<p>

I might have left it longer, but suddenly I was flying to Vancouver the next day to visit my sister and I could not pack until I tackled it. <em>It </em> was the mess of stuff accumulated during three years in Africa that I had casually left scattered across my desk, and on the floor in several bags and piles. Hours later I had succeeded in cleaning the space, and in finding a place for all the odd items I had been hesitant to sort through. A lot ended up in the trash. I let go of tickets, receipts, and old baggage tags. Whatever I planned to keep fit into a single tin box that used to contain assorted chocolates. I placed it gently atop one of several boxes that line the bottom shelf of my bookcase, under a stack of mostly empty diaries, and rows of texts I have admired more than read. The whole room seems to me an homage to false starts and lofty dreams that were never fully realized.</p>, <p>I used to call them my “memory boxes.” As I grew up it seemed foolish to keep so many scraps of the past, be they ticket stubs or notes passed in class, but I could not throw them away. Each adventure brought me new bits and pieces to save. High school and summer camp each had a box. My first trip to Africa had one too. There was a place for four years of university and a nook for the year spent studying afterwards in England. The collection has grown over the years and can no longer be arranged in as organized a fashion, and some have been relegated to the floor. I doubt I’d save them first in a fire, but so they remain after all this time, collecting dust.</p>, <p>Three years of swamp adventures (with a few sand dunes thrown in for good measure) were safely tucked away. Now was the time for fresh ambition and new goals. I would order more books! I would take up spinning and yoga and maybe run a half-marathon! I would find a new job, of course, and a perfect apartment that was really a small house, because I’ve always imagined having my own backyard and front porch. Once I’d ticked X next to all of these items on my not-at-all naive to-do list I would be able to get the thing I’ve wanted since I was old enough to conceive of my dreams in the first place: a puppy.</p>, <p>It will probably come as no surprise that my initial excitement and decisiveness has faded significantly since I arrived home last month. The only thing I am sure of is the name and breed of said puppy. I plan to have a boxer, and while I paused for some time considering the name Henry Higgins, I am now entirely committed to calling him Captain von Trapp, for obvious reasons. I might even take up sewing and fashion him a winter sweater out of curtains, because even dogs need play clothes!</p>, <p>Apologies for digressing.</p>, <p>Today I sat down to come up with a suitable name for this space, and to write about more immediate experiences. I’ve been home for a while, and life has gone on, albeit at a quieter pace than I’m used to. Frustrated by a lack of inspiration, I found myself with a chocolate box open next to the computer. I glanced gingerly at a few visible items; there were handwritten letters, postcards and photographs, and a note fashioned from dung and earth that welcomed me to the place where I touched the soft skin of an elephant for the first time, feeling the weight of ivory and wisdom in my hand.</p>, <p><img alt=""DSC0345"" height=""600"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/dsc0345.jpg?w=398&amp;h=600"" title=""_DSC0345.jpg"" width=""398""/></p>, <p>This blog needs a makeover – a spring clean if you will. I am no longer in Africa, and that will certainly inform my words from here on out. It also occurred to me today that I do not wish to add to my collection of little boxes. A tin container cannot hold the breadth of an adventure or the impact of wide-eyed discovery. There are too many stories enclosed to leave them shut. While I’m attempting to find a new place and function in my old stomping grounds, I want to record what I can of my most recent journey before it becomes too difficult to remember the more minute details, like the way the black and white feathers of my beloved pied kingfisher catch the light of setting sun over delta channels.</p>, <p>It’s often trying to focus on a place you still miss with large parts of your heart. Boxes don’t help much, but words do.</p>, <p>“Sometimes I need<br/>
only to stand<br/>
wherever I am<br/>

It was the simple and perfect combination of rye flour and her home-grown sourdough starter. I ate it hot, toasted, and slathered with butter and the creamiest honey I’ve ever sampled. We sat on the couch savouring slices for dessert, while watching Ina Garten bake a three-tiered chocolate buttercream cake. We laughed together at the delicious excess, and I forgot for a moment or two the previous afternoon’s goodbyes that had left my eyes red.</p>, <p>I had two slices for lunch the next day and savoured each bite, until it was time to drag my duffel to the front door. I closed the gate behind me and prepared to bid South Africa farewell, the unmistakable taste of home still lingering on my lips. Two long flights later, I walked into a much colder house. For the first time in years I did not have to face the prospect of leaving after a few weeks of long-awaited hellos; I was a permanent resident again.</p>, <p>Jobless and directionless, I found myself slightly terrified.</p>, <p>There were countless things that needed to be done – unpacking was certainly high on the list – but there was only one thing I felt like doing.</p>, <p>I started to bake. I spent my first Saturday back in Canada whipping up a pumpkin pie, a sweet potato pie, and a large batch of granola. I restocked the pantry with flour and sugar, and started buying an abundance of unsalted butter sticks. I became an avid <a href=""http://smittenkitchen.com/"" target=""_blank"" title=""smitten kitchen"">Smitten Kitchen</a> follower, and this resulted in my first <a href=""http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2007/09/mmm-bab-bee-bab-ka/"" target=""_blank"" title=""smitten kitchen's chocolate babka"">chocolate babka</a> attempt. I was too intimidated to go it alone, and was grateful for a wonderful friend who spent six hours teaching me to proof, knead, and turn. Our efforts were more than rewarded. It was as if chocolate and butter had married to produce a sweet and fluffy dough baby, with a heavy sprinkle of sugary crumble on top for good measure. If you think I sound crazy, I assume you’ve never tasted a great chocolate babka, and would suggest you do so as soon as possible.</p>, <p>There were adventures in cookies, chocolate ganache, and apple crumble. I made my first batch of cinnamon buns, going through several sachets of yeast before I was convinced they were activating properly. I made pie crust after pie crust, willing the flutes I shaped to stay in place when they baked. There was a failed experiment in royal icing; my distaste for the flavour was compounded by an apparent inability to pipe the stuff onto Martha’s sugar cookies. My cupcakes are not fantastic yet, and I suspect I’m about ten years away from tackling anything with tiers.</p>, <p>I possess no culinary prowess – I follow recipes to the letter and hope for the best. How then, can I explain that I am happiest standing at my counter with a rolling pin in hand, covered in a fine film of flour? Perhaps it is the same joy I imagine we all experience when we create something with our own hands that might be offered to those dear to us, whether or not the edges burn or the icing melts.</p>, <p>Soon after I came home my mom had to undergo major surgery, followed by a long and tough recovery. Not a night went by in those first few weeks that we did not share a meal that had been delivered to us by family and friends. They organized a supper rotation and made sure that our fridge was never empty. When I think about our little community, I realize that this is how it has always been. Wherever we are celebrating life, struggling through illness, or mourning death, there will be an abundance of food. Without knowing what to say, we can still show up, armed with sustenance.</p>, <p>I have been told that we must avoid confusing food with love. Even as the food itself nourishes, real fullness cannot be found on a plate. I suppose I see truth in this sentiment, but I would also argue that while food might not be love, making it is certainly an act of love.</p>, <p>A hearty meal is a gift that heals. The <a href=""http://www.lottieanddoof.com/2011/12/day-5-mathew-rice-and-gooey-butter-cookies/"" target=""_blank"" title=""gooey butter cookies "">right cookies</a> will put a smile on a friend’s face. I will even venture to tell you that a slice of homemade bread can ease the pain of difficult goodbyes when words really won’t do.</p>, <p><img alt=""DSC0322"" border=""0"" height=""505"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/dsc0322.jpg?w=600&amp;h=505"" title=""_DSC0322.JPG"" width=""600""/></p>, <p><em>Eat, drink, be happy.<br/>

The menus change, of course, but many dishes are as familiar as the people who prepare them. I can taste them now: Aunt Hazel’s chicken curry, Judy’s veal brisket, Jesse’s couscous, and my mom’s herb-crusted salmon, to name only a few. My dad is a wonderful cook, and he has whipped up countless dinner hits over the years, but his challah stands alone. His expertly prepared loaves are warmed with nostalgia and the memory of hundreds of Fridays gone by.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_4531.jpg""><img alt=""Braid"" class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-226"" data-attachment-id=""226"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""0"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":"""",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""0"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""0"",""iso"":""0"",""shutter_speed"":""0"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""DSC_4531.JPG"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_4531.jpg?w=750?w=600"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_4531.jpg?w=750?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_4531.jpg?w=750"" data-orig-size=""600,398"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2013/01/24/family-recipes-2/dsc_4531-jpg/"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_4531.jpg?w=750"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_4531.jpg 600w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_4531.jpg?w=150 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dsc_4531.jpg?w=300 300w""/></a></p>, <p>After I moved back home I told my dad that I was ready to learn how to make his challah. Up until this point I had avoided baking bread; as an inexperienced baker, I prefer precise recipes that leave little room for error. Bread is unpredictable, and my dad’s baking process is untidy in a way that has always maddened me slightly. He has a recipe, but it is more scribble than guide. His variations on the quantity of sugar and eggs make the bread his own. He does not measure out the flour carefully as I do. He neglects to shake the cup lightly to allow the grains to settle, and never sweeps the butter knife across the top to create a flat surface. He throws flour into the mix with ease, watching the dough gather and form, knowing instinctively when it is ready to be turned out and kneaded.</p>, <p>I am soon proving a less than capable student. I have split the readied dough into two rolls and braided it according to his patient instructions, but it isn’t working. The dough is sticking too much, as if the braid is melting into itself, and he tells me to start over. I knead it back together and he shows me how to use the whole weight of my body to press the dough into the counter. I separate it into two pieces again. He watches me roll, careful to point out the uneven parts so that I end up with something uniform from end to end. I lay one piece across the other and gingerly make my braid once more. A brush of egg wash and a sprinkle of sesame seeds later, I stare at the challah in near disbelief. It looks just like his. He is, in spite of my stubbornness, an exceptional teacher.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/challah.jpg""><img alt=""Challah.JPG"" class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-224"" data-attachment-id=""224"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""0"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":"""",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""0"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""0"",""iso"":""0"",""shutter_speed"":""0"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""Challah.JPG"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/challah.jpg?w=750?w=600"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/challah.jpg?w=750?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/challah.jpg?w=750"" data-orig-size=""600,426"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2013/01/24/family-recipes-2/challah-jpg/"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/challah.jpg?w=750"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/challah.jpg 600w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/challah.jpg?w=150 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/challah.jpg?w=300 300w""/></a></p>, <p>The challah is baking in the oven, and I sit with a cup of steaming tea in hand, breathing in the heady scent of my favourite bread. I glance up at a photograph hanging next to the pantry that shows my late Granny Rae’s hand on a piece of kichel dough, gently pulling it through a rusted metal pasta roller. Our parents ate her kichel with the traditional chopped herring, but my sister and I snatched them up plain, all sugar and delectable crumb. As my dad showed me how to braid the challah dough, my mom might have said that it seemed as if Granny was back in the kitchen, happy to see us baking again.</p>, <p>Tonight, in a place that is much too far from where I sit, my sister is busy baking her own challahs. She called me earlier this evening in a slight panic over the state of the yeast. Having thrown out two batches that failed to proof, she was about to embark on a third attempt. I told her to use a different kind of yeast, and after consulting with my dad, she started over. We chatted while she watched and waited, until it finally began to bubble. She’ll be busy kneading now, and in an hour or so, she’ll fashion her braids the way dad taught us to. I imagine her standing at a counter dusted with flour, working the dough, just as our granny did on countless other Fridays. Her hands are younger, but they carry a timeless wisdom. It is a wisdom spun from a generation that survives in photographs and recipes scribbled on yellowed paper. Years from now, when my sister’s hands are lined and worn with age, I know that they will still be consumed with the same task – creating that which fills the belly and the heart.</p>, <p>We want to learn to make what they made, and when it isn’t quite right, we are grateful for the kind father who shows us how. For all the Fridays I missed – for all the help I neglected to offer – for all the hours and days I fear I’ve long forgotten – I will commit at least this lesson in bread making to memory. I will remember to pause each week, to knead, turn, and honour with some small act the treasured traditions and beloved hands whose palms fell soft upon my young shoulders.</p>]","[<p>

I read it in bits and pieces, in those stolen minutes before sleep, when I am alone and something moves me to pick up the dusty book from where it lies next to my bed. It is curiosity, I suppose, and not an urgency so profound as to call me to question and grow fearful. Sometimes I see beauty in the pages. Sometimes I recognize a saying I have heard frequently and I am surprised to learn that it was borne of this ancient work. On most nights the unkindness I detect in the words gives me somber pause and then the tiny text is out of focus and I close the cover in a hurry.</p>, <p>I keep returning to the story. When I was a child, it was chanted from scrolls written in another language and though I understood almost nothing, I loved it more than I suspect I ever will again. I knew too little to doubt the source of what I read and heard. It is difficult to recall now, but I’m not certain I even thought the tale to be true. The accuracy of these books was not relevant or important. They contained a history and the weight of lessons that I was sure applied to me. I <i>believed</i> in the way that only children can, enveloped in the warmth of faith that has not yet been scarred by the pain of an oft broken earth.</p>, <p>Somewhere between then and now my faith shifted from a place of apathy to a place of anger. As a student of history I was drawn to religion. I pored over the writings of clerics, soaked up the biographies of reformers, and read with fascination the re-telling of battles and wars waged over the interpretation of words. These bloody histories were not for the faint of heart, and they shaped my consideration of faith, and all that it implied. I lost touch with the child who once believed, until there was no longer a trace, even in the vestiges of my memory, of the ghost of this girl who knew God.</p>, <p>Then I moved to Botswana, farther than I ever had been from the reminders of the religion I was rooted in, and into a new community of people with an unshakeable belief in God. All around me the faithful were steadfast and doubt was wholly absent. I was prayed for by my colleagues, blessed, and urged to pray and count my blessings. I was often told that my day of reckoning had already been chosen for me. “Death will come,” they said. Yes, indeed, but the strongest parts of me still hoped that I might play some role in the circumstances of my ending.</p>, <p>I’ll admit that as the months passed, my cynicism softened. I began to listen with genuine interest and found myself, for the first time in my life, jealous of what the faithful possessed. I wondered what comfort I might take in surrendering worry and fear to something outside of myself. During my last week at work, P, the head chef, told me that she would pray for my mom’s good health. I thanked her, not with veiled doubt or reservation, but with overwhelming gratitude for her compassion. I left with a feeling of respect for faith and the goodness it contained, even as I knew that I could not take it up for myself.</p>, <p>I am back home, and after several years nearly devoid of any religious celebration, I have been here to take part in the holidays again. I can share challah and wine with my family, and softly chant the same blessings I sung happily as a child. The familiarity of the ritual feels inviting and safe. I am undoubtedly thankful to call it mine, yet I still struggle to reconcile my practice of these traditions with all that I’ve learned. I try to separate ritual from doctrine and the lines remain fuzzy. The book closes, and I have to accept that there will be always be more questions than answers.</p>, <p>I meant to say something about faith, and instead I’ve laid out another unfinished story, and one whose final chapter is out of reach.</p>, <p>I meant to say something of my own faith, but I fear I have never been, and will never be, a grand storyteller. I can only write what I know, and when it comes to God, there is so little that I have ever been certain of.</p>, <p>If you ask me what I believe, I will tell you this: I have made mistakes. I have spoken too quickly and caused hurt with poorly chosen words. There are times that I think I should pray for forgiveness, but it feels unnatural, so I pause, step outside, and tilt my head up. Beneath a sky painted by city lights, I am left to imagine those most precious nights – the ones undisturbed by the moon – when the stars are brightest. I am insignificant, standing solitary under the immense black canvas. I remember how small I am and this brings me more peace than all the ancient words I have read.</p>, <p>You ask me what I believe, and I can only tell you about this tiny space between my heart and the illuminated universe that extends beyond comprehension. In this sliver of silence cut from a world gone mad with noise, I find for a moment, a dark corner that contains the whole of my faith.</p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>, <p> </p>]","[<p>

I dream of the assorted lifetimes ago and it returns to me, a gentle tug at a heart that has nearly forgotten.</p>, <p>I once fell in love in the span of an evening. Usually it’s much slower, but however it occurs, the shift is immeasurable. A different kind of happiness presents itself and there are moments I hold it in my palms in such a way that love becomes tactile, filling the gaps between our tightly clasped hands. I feel it there in the nook of his chest in the precious hours before sleeping.</p>, <p>I want to know where it goes.</p>, <p>Where does he place my secrets and where do I hide his? You come to know someone so remarkably, and I ask whether this knowledge of the other is lost.</p>, <p>I know that I carry it with me. I throw the tangible remnants away, but something settles there. I might lose track of the details, but this does not alter the deeper sense of remembering. I cannot forget that I’ve loved, even when the spark has burned out and the scent of old ash can no longer be detected.</p>, <p>Perhaps it’s a bit like the patch of ancient earth I left. I used to be perpetually covered in a fine layer of dust. My hands and feet were stained with the stuff, no matter how hard I scrubbed. If you saw me now you’d never guess it. My nails are polished, and my curls are tame. My skin is clean and grows paler each month. I live in a city now. There are fewer spiders on my walls and the bugs (mostly) stay outside at night. If, however, I examine the parts that aren’t so visible, I find that I am still altered by it. The dust and dirt have marked me further beneath the surface. The heat of African sun warms me and sometimes, when I blink, I see George and his billowing eyelashes. His steady and proud gaze is upon me and for a moment I am back in the swamps, at peace in the shadow of giants. I would like to know that the earth that I so loved remembers me too – that my soles left some imprint there – but I will never be privy to such knowledge.</p>, <p>A place changes you. The people you loved change you. The wisdom, the joy, and the hurt take up residence in your being, undetectable to everyone else. There is pain in asking where the love goes. There is sadness in wondering if you carry its memory in solitude. Then I imagine that to know this is not so important now.</p>, <p>I have loved – men and corners of paradise – with equal earnest. I have said goodbye to both, but this does not erase the acts I performed, both tiny and grand. All that I gave away I gave to myself too. I remain marked with the wondrous colors that reflect the measure of my passions.</p>, <p>I used to begrudge the reminders. I considered them an intrusion – an affront of sorts to the life I was trying to build for myself. Then I came to understand that I owed my current contentment to all that came before, even the parts I thought I should forget. Every story begins and ends; there are difficult chapters and joyous chapters, and to remove any would fragment something that was never broken. Cup of coffee in hand, standing in the first kitchen that belongs to me, in a city I already adore, I am no longer afraid to confront the memory of old places and faces. They brought me here, and for that my heart is grateful. Nothing more and nothing less.</p>]","[<p>

I wanted to offer up some hero or heroine, a struggle between good and evil, or a tale of loss. I sat down and never made it much further than the opening line.</p>, <p>It used to be easy, when the violent drama of survival was played out against each brilliant sunset. There were the terrifying and beautiful hunters, and the prey that ran, hid, and lived for another day or hour. I saw animals die, gasping for air in the death grips of the painted wolves and cats that instilled fear in every fibre of my being the moment I left the safety of my little home for the wilderness outside. It might sound strange, but that fear – that knowledge that I was always in danger of disturbing the bush and the mighty giants it hid – gave me peace. As my date of departure grew near, I relished the feeling of dry leaves giving way to dust beneath my feet, and the quickening of my heart at even the slightest noise that met me in the darkness. I had to say goodbye, but my chest ached at the prospect of leaving this place – and place is a word ill-suited to describe the Linyanti, the keeper of so many stories.</p>, <p><i>The constant dirt had made my fingers rough so they caught on every groove and nook of your surface and my hands wanted to keep searching, reaching for every undiscovered corner. Though my palms would not release you, it was time to go. I bent my head to the elephants and let the sand run through my fingers one last time, hoping it might leave some imprint there.</i></p>, <p><i></i>Part of me wonders if I will ever be able to write about anything else. Desire always brings me back to the page, but I’m not sure what’s worth recording anymore. I don’t know how to bring meaning to the simple ebb and flow of the everyday. I never intended to share many details of my life here, but in the absence of a thrilling saga, that is all I have to offer.</p>, <p>I long to be inspired as I once was, but I am also sure that I am meant to be here, far from the wilderness that I fell for with such abandon. Over a year has passed since I left, and I am struck by how much there is to be thankful for. I was home when my family needed me (and when I needed them). Mom is healthy. I get to see B and her little ones every few weeks, and J knows my name and greets me with a smile when I walk through the door. Months don’t pass between visits to my old home, and we get to do all the things I missed when I was away; coffee each morning, breakfasts at our favourite greasy diner, and long Friday night dinners with kind and familiar faces.</p>, <p>I found a job last January and moved to the city. I discovered brunch, and ordered dozens of eggs before picking a <a href=""http://www.auntiesanduncles.ca/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Aunties &amp; Uncles"">favourite</a>. I saw <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri6bd4G-Aig&amp;feature=kp"" target=""_blank"" title=""James Blake"">many </a><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_ok4Hcj-lE"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Boom Booms"">wonderful</a> concerts and I remembered how happy music made me. I <a href=""http://smittenkitchen.com/book/"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook"">baked </a>in my new kitchen and my mom taught me how to properly roast a chicken. The purchase of kitchen appliances, more than anything else, seemed to signal a genuine entrance to adulthood. In a further attempt to join the ranks of the young professional, I went on my fair share of first and second dates, discovering new <a href=""http://northwoodto.ca/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Northwood"">favourite places</a> in the process. I wore down my shoes walking everywhere I could, and rested my tired feet in the first apartment I’ve ever called my own. At the end of the year I went to Costa Rica and finally conquered my fear of the ocean. Thanks to a gentle surf and a fine and patient teacher, I caught my first waves. Today my dad sent me a picture of my sister and I watching the sunset on the last night of the trip. Back in a chilly city, I lament the lack of sunshine, but know too that life has been good to me.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/sisters.jpg""><img alt=""Sisters"" class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-294"" data-attachment-id=""294"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""0"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":"""",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""0"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""0"",""iso"":""0"",""shutter_speed"":""0"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""Sisters"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/sisters.jpg?w=750?w=640"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/sisters.jpg?w=750?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/sisters.jpg?w=750"" data-orig-size=""640,425"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2014/03/05/in-progress/sisters/"" sizes=""(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/sisters.jpg?w=750"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/sisters.jpg 640w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/sisters.jpg?w=150 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/sisters.jpg?w=300 300w""/></a></p>, <p>It isn’t perfect, but then nothing, not even my time in the Linyanti, ever was. How easy it is to forget the difficult parts when we leave a place. Maybe it’s a sign of my age that I have begun to welcome life in a slightly rougher form. I like to think that the rough patches exist to bring what’s great into sharper focus. While there are days I miss Botswana desperately, I am equally grateful for the shape of things now.</p>, <p>Still, I have no story. All I’ve been able to muster are a few reflections on another passing year. I was always taught that a tale should begin and end. <em>The lion takes chase and the impala draws its final breath.</em> All my stories remain in progress. There is work, and a city, and hints of adventure hidden between the cracks of these weary sidewalks. This will have to do, for now.</p>, <p>Not for the first time, I’ve been drawn to my oft neglected bookshelf, getting lost in the words of those who seem to effortlessly give form to the human experience, both real and imagined. In these pages, if I’m lucky, I will find my way to the beginning of the story I am meant to tell.</p>, <p><em>“The book exists for us, perchance, which will explain our miracles and reveal new ones. The at present unutterable things we may find somewhere uttered.”</em></p>, <p>– Henry David Thoreau</p>]","[<p>

My eyes were heavy when I put it down, but I still struggled to drift off. It wasn’t a book I expected to like, let alone stay up far too late for. Yet, there I was, shaken by hazy visions of the dead man’s walk that kept sleep at bay. I was tired, and saddened that I had reached the conclusion of the story. I never cease to be moved by the magnetism of a wonderful tale. I felt grateful to have found this one, and eager to lose myself in another as soon as time allowed.</p>, <p>Until then my dreams will drift to a bare and dangerous plain in a West that no longer exists. A good story visits us again and again, even when we’ve put it to rest. I long to be bewitched by some passage – left wondering if spells might not be cast beyond the pages of a favourite fairy tale. Sitting by a campfire, watching smoke rise and send the mosquitoes back to the woods, I’ll ask for one last yarn before we return to our tents. To hear tell of a monster and know that sleep will not come as easy; there is a strange beauty in that. How stirring it is that simple words, spun in such a way, can cause the heart to beat faster and the mind to wander to a place where terrors come to life, and journeys, fraught with peril, make heroes of ordinary men.</p>, <p>The right book refuses to be forgotten on the shelf. I’ll close the cover and I think the lines wind outward, resting quietly in the wings of my imagination. A day or two passes and I find myself searching for the words in subtle ways. I look for meaning in common gestures. Is this stranger whose eyes meet mine the character upon whom the entire plot depends?</p>, <p>I jump from one chapter to another, and it’s as if I’ve never realized how quickly a narrative can course in a new direction. This reminder of constant possibility is what makes a story great. When I spend too long away from books I forget that no day passes without offering a chance to alter the ending. Maybe today I’ll walk down a different street, and say hello instead of lowering my gaze.</p>, <p>One minute I’ll be carrying on as usual, and the next the roar of the city will shrink to a whisper and everything will have changed. The grand adventure begins.</p>, <p><a href=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dscn0401.jpg""><img alt=""DSCN0401"" class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-304"" data-attachment-id=""304"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""4.9"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":""COOLPIX L1"",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""-62169984000"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""6.3"",""iso"":""50"",""shutter_speed"":""0.0007315824127588"",""title"":""""}' data-image-title=""DSCN0401"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dscn0401.jpg?w=750"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dscn0401.jpg?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dscn0401.jpg"" data-orig-size=""2048,1536"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2014/05/04/what-im-reading/dscn0401/"" sizes=""(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dscn0401.jpg?w=750&amp;h=563"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dscn0401.jpg?w=750&amp;h=563 750w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dscn0401.jpg?w=1500&amp;h=1126 1500w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dscn0401.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dscn0401.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dscn0401.jpg?w=768&amp;h=576 768w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/dscn0401.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=768 1024w""/></a></p>]","[<p>

I’ll begin to write, each time with new resolve, and quickly find myself unsatisfied with what fills the page. I could blame the setting, as I have before, but that feels cheap. I’m not living in the wild anymore, but the city has offered up plenty of opportunity to seek adventure. Still, I can’t write a damn thing that’s worth keeping. I’ve said this before, but now the sentiment comes with an answer. A brief word of warning; if you came here to read a tightly woven narrative, you may be disappointed in what follows.</p>, <p>I am a great performer. I don’t mean this in the traditional sense. I mean that I am very particular about the way in which I’m perceived. In subtle (and not so subtle) ways, I bend to meet the demands of my role. When I was with safari guests in Botswana, I played the host. When I was navigating a new workplace in Toronto, I played the professional. When I was sitting down with a date for the first time, I played cute. I would eventually ease into a level of comfort with the people I met, but I never revealed the rough edges too soon. Of course, we all do this. Life and work demands it of us. In truth, I was always being myself, just not all at once.</p>, <p>Thanks to some gentle nudging from the people who know me best, I am finally learning to let it go. I know that I’m not everyone’s cup of tea, and that’s fine. I’ve even made a public declaration amongst friend to just. give. less. f*cks. Try as I might, the way I am received by others will not be moved by my efforts. Take it or leave it – all I can do is offer up something honest.</p>, <p>The thing is, words are far too easy to bend. I have always edited faster than I could write, smoothing the jagged edges before the lines were fully formed. This is not to say that I haven’t enjoyed the process. I am proud of every entry and story I’ve shared here. It’s given me purpose, and reason to preserve the bits of my own history that I know I’ll return to for comfort and wisdom. I’ve been honest, but I’ve also omitted a great deal. I thought that if I wanted to be a writer, each passage needed to be free of roughness and error. Mostly, I wanted you to love it. I decided long ago that I needed to present my words in a very particular way, and as evidenced by my lack of activity here, I was stubborn as hell about it….until today.</p>, <p>By way of explanation, I want to address the rest of this entry to my sister, who is equal parts gentle and powerful in a way that those who have the privilege of knowing her will understand well.</p>, <p>Raphaela, I have never met another person who dreams as confidently as you. Just when I think I’ve figured out where the trajectory of your incredible existence is headed, you surprise me by throwing out the map altogether. You’ve never bent. You’ve never let fear or doubt stop you from becoming exactly the person you are meant to be. Through the simple act of living as you do, you’ve imparted a multitude of lessons, the latest of which brought me here this evening. I asked how it was that you could so freely change the course of your life and maintain faith in what would come to pass as a result. I suppose I thought that some choices were already set in stone, and were not likely to shift. Well, in classic Raph fashion, you laughed and told me “there is no land of stones.” It sounded slightly silly at the time, but I knew it was true. It was also a gift.</p>, <p>You see, I’d been quietly collecting stones of my own, each one a place I imagined my life would land. There was the “perfect” career, the “perfect” home, and even this “perfect” little blog. But under the weight of all these stones, I stopped taking risks. Then you reminded me that I was completely missing the point.</p>, <p>I’m not sure what that means for this blog. I am certain that I want to omit less. It won’t always be pretty. It might not be any good at all. Here is what I do know: when I promised my sister that I would keep writing, I meant it. In order to do that, I’m going to have to give less f*cks about how my words are received. Keeping this promise might mean that my sister is one of the only people who keeps reading, but no matter. That she, whose brilliance never ceases to astound me, continues to call me a writer, is enough.</p>, <p>Love, Abiella</p>]","[<p>

I was midway through the weekly baking class I’ve been taking for the past month or so, and I thought, nearly aloud, about how much I hated washing dishes. In quick succession I considered my dislike for piping cookie dough, my disdain for piping icing, and my frustration with the way shortening sticks to the spoon when scaled. On each of the past eight Mondays, I have silently cursed the weight of my bag of knives and steel toed boots while forcing my way onto the subway. Still, something was bringing me back to those dishes each week. Something was gently slowing the pulse of constant worry as I struggled to shape cookies into hearts that looked more like puddles.</p>, <p>Baking, like writing, calms me as much as it invigorates me. I knead dough, scrub dirty pots, or play with a turn of phrase, and the minutes that pass are consumed by the task at hand. Generally distracted by attempts to edit a past I can’t change and shape a future I’ve already imagined, these moments of presence are rare. Baking, like writing, requires a focus that pulls me back from the stories I tell myself about my life to the life I am actually living.</p>, <p>Sometimes I feel uneasy in this body. Sometimes I feel unsteadied by the accumulation of years and the growing list of unknowns. I know that I have no business complaining, but I won’t deny that there are days when it’s difficult to sit with it.</p>, <p>Let me start over. Scraping the chocolate off of a measuring spoon, I was struck by a simple truth; I am, in fact, existing and breathing and loving at this very second. I paused, soapy water up to my elbows, and wondered what life might be like if I allowed myself to sink into more moments as deeply, to let the mess gather, to stop drifting backwards and forwards to anywhere but the space I occupy. Back home fighting sleep I will my body to make room for this lesson. It is as true now as it was when I stood there by the kitchen sink. There is nowhere to be but here.</p>]","[<p>

A steady pour and the soft clink of ice meeting spirits. The first sip goes down hot, then smooth. The second tickles my throat, and the third is delectable contentment.</p>, <p>Sometimes I wish that more of life could be savoured then put to rest with so little trouble. If I could treat more moments like this – if just a taste were enough to quiet longing – it might make it easier to walk away free of regret.</p>, <p>I fear the unrequited wanting.</p>, <p>One wave will never be enough. After the shock of the first drop, and the tenth tumble in relentless current, you will love it more deeply than you did the day before.

You will arrive terrified of the dark, strange howls turning your spine cold, until the calls of beasts become your lullabies. You will leave to be confronted by a city whose silence is unsettling, even as sirens blare and traffic screeches by.</p>, <p>A handful of days in an unfamiliar place will never be enough. There is something about walking amidst a sea of strangers that makes it easier to return to yourself, to abandon the worry that you already knew mattered little.

When my eyes grow heavy I will visit the waves again. I will be warmed by the gentle glare of a delta sunset. I will eagerly cross an unfamiliar street. I will feel the weight of his hand in mine.

The bay is rocked by a soft current, sending gentle waves dancing to the edge of the horizon. Standing close to the water I take stock of the soil and rock at my feet and I want to sink in as deep as the ground allows.</p>, <p>Strange that on countless evenings I hid dusk behind closed blinds and welcomed nightfall. I was tired and racing to finish one day so I could try again in earnest the next. Tiny regrets were gathering and I flung them away with the covers before I settled into sleep. Tomorrow I would correct all the errors and address the careless omissions, if only tomorrow could come a little faster.</p>, <p>Now breath slows as I watch the golden crest dip and disappear. The light remains for a short time, bowing to the hands of the clock that chase it into oblivion. There is an unnerving distinction between the minutes that pass like hours, and the hours, like those spent tucked away amongst sloped granite and old pine, that depart as suddenly as dust flies to the wind.</p>, <p>The dreamscape of pinks and blues gives way to muddied pools of black, until I’m bracing against an endless darkness pierced only by stars. I am caught halfway between bliss and aching. I find immeasurable joy in places like this – the corners of earth with landscapes mighty enough to make me feel small. These are also the places hardest to leave. The city bursts with noise and hurried movement, but it is here on a near silent shore that time moves too quickly.</p>]","[<p>

Sinking my weight into it over and over, I worked in the flour until the cracks were made smooth and it felt as I remembered it should. Patiently I let it rise – three times – and broke it into small pieces for braiding. Accepting that my fourth attempt at a six-strand braid would have to do, I carefully coated it with an egg wash that I hoped would impart a deep amber shine.</p>, <p>Home, I thought, is in a hot kitchen made dusty with flour. Here, where cookies cool by the window and chocolate babkas wait to be drenched in sticky sweet gloss.</p>, <p>Home, I thought, is by the bookshelves filled with volumes collected since childhood.

Here, where the flowers died before autumn, and I promised to do better next year. Here, where the mums planted as summer departed are blossoming still, lending colour and warmth to grey stone steps.</p>, <p>Home, I thought, is in a bedroom dotted with pictures that remind me of the places I occupied before this one. Here, where I dream of the beauty I’ve left behind and the less fully formed possibility of what’s to come.</p>, <p>The challah was nearly finished baking and the house was filled with the scent of so many other holidays and Friday afternoons in a home several hours away. I pulled the tray from the oven with relief. The braided loaf was golden brown, and, albeit slightly misshapen, still unmistakably round – a nod to the holiday I was hosting for the first time.</p>, <p>Home, I thought, is in the dining room where friends gather to celebrate. Here, where I stumble over phrases I barely understand to honour traditions that will survive far longer than these four walls. Here, where I create the memories that I will pack along with my belongings when I go. And go I will, though I don’t know when.</p>, <p>For now it feels right to settle in.

They asked my mom if she wanted to be introduced to him, and she said yes. It was November.</p>, <p>The night he called her, she had been in a car accident. She told him that no, a date was not possible, but it would be once she had recovered. He thought this sounded like a convenient excuse for declining a blind date, and asked that she call him when she did want to meet. He had a stronger accent then, and I like to think that the minute she heard his voice for the first time she sensed that this stranger would become something else entirely.</p>, <p>In February of the next year, she did call him, and they went on their first date. The last first date for them both.</p>, <p>Before I tell you what happened next I have to emphasize that my mom’s recollection of that night is more precious to me than any other part of the past that I’ve inherited from my family. More precious even than the name given to me to honour the grandfathers I never knew.</p>, <p>She came home, called her mother, and told her, “I’ve met the man I’m going to marry.” Time and again she tells me: when you know, you know.</p>, <p><img alt=""parents"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-398"" data-attachment-id=""398"" data-comments-opened=""1"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""0"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":"""",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""0"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""0"",""iso"":""0"",""shutter_speed"":""0"",""title"":"""",""orientation"":""0""}' data-image-title=""parents"" data-large-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/parents.jpg?w=750?w=379"" data-medium-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/parents.jpg?w=750?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/parents.jpg?w=750"" data-orig-size=""379,241"" data-permalink=""https://thelilacelephant.com/2016/07/12/knowing/parents/"" sizes=""(max-width: 379px) 100vw, 379px"" src=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/parents.jpg?w=750"" srcset=""https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/parents.jpg 379w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/parents.jpg?w=150 150w, https://abiinafrica.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/parents.jpg?w=300 300w""/></p>, <p>Marry him she did, in December, barely a year after that first phone call. I understand it was made bittersweet by the absence of their fathers. She had lost hers only a year and a half before. She had a terrible migraine that day, and hated her dress, but she loved him, and he her, and I imagine that the bright spark between them was undeniably felt by all who attended. I feel it now, whenever one of them joins the other in a room, regardless of the length of time spent apart. If you are lucky enough to meet them, watch her eyes find his as she calls to him. Listen to the tenor and warmth of his laugh when he teases her.</p>, <p>That my dad’s recollection of the same first date was slightly different than hers, that he remembers meeting a woman who possessed several qualities he had sworn off in potential mates, does not lessen the story’s magic. It only serves to remind me that our stories are never wholly ours. We can write the first few lines before they take on lives of their own, bending and opening up space for the characters we could never have given shape to ourselves.</p>, <p>He tells us that she was a nail-biter, who smoked and had terrible taste in fashion, as evidenced by the ugly brown pants she was wearing (his assessment, not hers). He also had a girlfriend in New York that he had not quite broken up with yet. He did not call her after that night; he had other chapters to close. Had it not been <em>her</em> – had it not been <em>them</em> – this might have been the story’s conclusion. If you are lucky enough to meet them, you will understand why it was not.</p>, <p>She called him, and he answered, and almost all at once their lives became this life. It is one that I do not give thanks for often enough – one that has become so much more than its beginning. The beauty of falling in love pales next to the beauty of accepting and continuing to love another person through all that comes next.</p>, <p>He supported her while she earned her PhD and they raised two young children. She welcomed his mother into our home as she neared the end of her life. He helped her pack up her mother’s apartment after she died. My dad’s nomadic tendencies have not lessened with age. He tells her he plans on scaling mountains, and I know that she wishes she could walk next to him. I also know that theirs is a relationship of deep respect for the other’s independence and wholeness of spirit. She will let him go, when he needs to go. He will never begrudge her the hesitation.</p>, <p>Careers expanded. Adventure called them to far corners of the earth, both together and apart. Children grew up (mostly), and left for new homes. Sickness brought darkness, and recovery even greater resilience. The spark remained. My chest swells contemplating the ways they have loved each other in those moments. Such is the weight of their story.</p>, <p>So when she tells me that she knew, the night she met him, that this life would be theirs, her words are precious.</p>, <p>There were times that those same words made me uneasy, because I had never come close to uttering them. Then I shared this story with someone for the first time, hoping to pass on at least a tiny sliver of the magic it contained. To tell it, I thought, and still be as stirred by the words as I was; to believe this deeply that such a meeting of souls was possible, was enough.</p>, <p>I don’t know if ours is the story I will be asked to retell, but I know that it will find its place on a blank page soon.</p>, <p>I don’t know how this ends, but I know that I am grateful for its beginning.</p>, <p>I don’t know if this is <em>the</em> story, but I know it’s a good one.</p>, <p>I know.</p>, <p> </p>]","[<p>

Kicking up dirt I can gather the words and worries that had, until then, made sleep troublesome, and cast them off gently. The more breathless I become, the easier it is to breathe and simply be. New words form – the beginnings of stories I’ve been searching for in vain. A handful of passages to be collected here, at the top of this hill. The conclusion waits patiently there, at the end of the last sprint.</p>, <p>I suspect that it is not the healthiest habit. Several weeks into training and the aches become more pronounced. I’ll take off a bloody pair of socks, patch another blister, and curse my shins. My body responds so poorly that I limit myself to a few months of running a year; my shoes will grow dusty in the back of the closet once this race is over.</p>, <p>I am aware that I may pay for this mileage later, and also certain that the pleasure of the act makes the trade-off worth it. They say life is too short, and this truth presents us with a choice between the pursuits that might extend our years, and those that cause us to ask for extra time.</p>, <p>If instinct tells me that words rest in the shadows of fleeting twilight, I will choose to write instead of sleep. If my heart asks to return to the last time we spoke, I will play the song too loud again. If the days passed blissfully next to sand and surf are winding to a close, I will paddle into another wave, ignoring the throbbing pain in my maddeningly sensitive ears.</p>, <p>I make these choices knowing that subtle marks are likely to remain long after the final wave, or verse subsides. Enough precious early morning runs, and the whisper of sore muscles will gradually increase in volume until I’m forced to rest, at least until the next spring thaw arrives. On rare occasions the consequences of happiness are sketched more immediately. I will spend several hours laughing next to him and find the grooves on my skin deepened more by a single evening than what feels like an eternity of responsible days spent in quieter company. I will be cautious with this life, yes, and careful too, but not so much that I miss the chance to inhabit moments that expand beyond the confines of minutes or years.</p>, <p>Running is not good for me, but there is no doubt that it does me good. My body braces to absorb the impact of each step, until soles are left as battered as the soul is soothed.</p>, <p> </p>]","[<p>

I recalled all the sentiments scribbled on birthday cards purchased in haste, and wondered if I could do better this time.</p>, <p>Easiest to articulate is gratitude for the gifts I can grasp with my own palms.</p>, <p>The door to a home whose warm comfort we’ll seek always, even if we protest your refusal to adjust the thermostat (“Why don’t you put on a sweater?” you say with a smile).</p>, <p>The meals and recipes that make it possible to fill newer homes with the familiar scents of old traditions. Dishes piled high with enough food to feed an army. The chicken soup that you fret over despite our insistence that each batch is better than the last. All the carefully labelled lunches packed in our bags when we go.</p>, <p>The arms outstretched to greet us, to soothe us, to say goodbye. Never too hurried, even as we hurry away.</p>, <p>Harder to compose are thanks for gifts that cannot be held, though we grip them just as tightly.</p>, <p>The hours, years, and adventures we’ve stitched into a rich tapestry of shared history. The reassurance that we are not the sole keepers of the stories we’ve collected, both wonderful and strange.

We fail to heed it, fail again, forget the words entirely, and your patience is an astounding blessing.</p>, <p>The knowledge of our capacity for ugliness, and the acceptance you extend when we say things we wish we’d never said. You weather the onslaught of anger, frustration, and grief reserved for those we trust will see who we are, and love us still. You forgive first so that we might forgive ourselves.</p>, <p>I am certain that this is the source of all my attempts at bravery. Every chance I take, I take because I know that I can fuck up completely and return to the same home, the same laughter, the same understanding. I can navigate pangs of loneliness and moments of uncertainty with occasional ferocity, because I am fiercely aware of your presence, wherever I find myself. There is no greater gift.</p>]","[<p>

Characters were met with expectant pause; nervous exchanges of secrets and histories hinted at what was to come, but always came to collapse in tired finales. The loose ends I tied up with lines I fashioned alone. Writing was a selfish act, a means of pressing the rough edges of experience into an object smooth enough to hold with both hands and examine, until it could be laid to rest in memory, the weight no longer a burden.</p>, <p>Then last summer, emboldened by too many drinks and the warm cover of twilight, I pushed gingerly at a door I hoped had not closed for the last time. It was not yet time for us, but I knew then, as I do now, that with our quiet admissions we had written the beginning of my favourite story. In that first embrace there was nothing left to unpack or make smooth, no lines to fashion beyond the ones spoken since in the precious minutes and hours we spent upon waking, nestled comfortably, as we were, in a universe for two.</p>, <p>I wonder how many great works of art were born of joy, of the sweet contentment that accompanies life’s pleasures, both simple and otherworldly. I wait patiently for prose, but I find myself too happily ensconced in these pages, some dog-eared and familiar, and some bursting with the bloom of seasons yet discovered. Still, I am certain that I must return here soon to document what I can of the mostly banal passing of days, coloured, though they are, by new and brilliant brushstrokes.</p>, <p>Life was good and beautiful before you, my love, but never have I yearned so ferociously to freeze time.</p>]"
